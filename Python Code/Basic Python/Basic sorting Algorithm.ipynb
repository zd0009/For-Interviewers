    "When trying to characterize an algorithm’s efficiency in terms of execution time, independent of any particular program or computer, it is important to quantify the number of operations or steps that the algorithm will require. If each of these steps is considered to be a basic unit of computation, then the execution time for an algorithm can be expressed as the number of steps required to solve the problem. Deciding on an appropriate basic unit of computation can be a complicated problem and will depend on how the algorithm is implemented.\n",

    "As anexample, suppose that for some algorithm, the exact number of steps is T(n)=5n^2+27n+1005. When n is small, say 1 or 2, the constant 1005 seems to be the dominant part of the function. However, as n gets larger, the n^2 term becomes the most important. In fact, when n is really large, the other two terms become insignificant in the role that they play in determining the final result. Again, to approximate T(n) as n gets large, we can ignore the other terms and focus on 5n^2. In addition, the coefficient 5 becomes insignificant as n gets large. We would say then that the function T(n) has an order of magnitude f(n)=n^2, or simply that it is O(n^2).\n",

    "How to quantify the performance of an algorithm? We could quantify it by(i)time cost and (ii) space cost. For time cost, Big O notation describes how much runtime an algorithm takes to run as the size n of input data set increases. In other words, Big O notation shows how quickly the runtime of executing an algorithm grows in “worst case”. For space cost, Big O notation describes how large of additional space(relative to the size n of input data set) an algorithm needs."

    "Why do we need “Big O” notation? In order to choose the suitable algorithm for the problem we want to solve. For example, if we want to sort a list, and here are different algorithms to accomplish this task(e.g. Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort). In order to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, we use “Big O” notation. Sometimes we will choose an algorithm that occupies less space but more time if additional space is very expensive to the company."
