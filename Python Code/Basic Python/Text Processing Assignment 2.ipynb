      "i lived there two years and two months.\n",
      "at present i am a sojourner in civilized life again.\n",
      "i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent.\n",
      "some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like.\n",
      "others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained.\n",
      "i will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if i undertake to answer some of these questions in this book.\n",
      "in most books the i or first person is omitted in this it will be retained that in respect to egotism is the main difference.\n",
      "we commonly do not remember that it is after all always the first person that is speaking.\n",
      "i should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom i knew as well.\n",
      "unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience.\n",
      "moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land for if he has lived sincerely it must have been in a distant land to me.\n",
      "perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students.\n",
      "as for the rest of my readers they will accept such portions as apply to them.\n",
      "i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits.\n",
      "i would fain say something not so much concerning the chinese and sandwich islanders as you who read these pages who are said to live in new england something about your condition especially your outward condition or circumstances in this world in this town what it is whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is whether it cannot be improved as well as not.\n",
      "i have travelled a good deal in concord and everywhere in shops and offices and fields the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways.\n",
      "what i have heard of brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun or hanging suspended with their heads downward over flames or looking at the heavens over their shoulders until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach or dwelling chained for life at the foot of a tree or measuring with their bodies like caterpillars the breadth of vast empires or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars—even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which i daily witness.\n",
      "the twelve labors of hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have undertaken for they were only twelve and had an end but i could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor.\n",
      "they have no friend iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydras head but as soon as one head is crushed two spring up.\n",
      "i see young men my townsmen whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms houses barns cattle and farming tools for these are more easily acquired than got rid of.\n",
      "better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in.\n",
      "who made them serfs of the soil.\n",
      "why should they eat their sixty acres when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt.\n",
      "why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born.\n",
      "they have got to live a mans life pushing all these things before them and get on as well as they can.\n",
      "how many a poor immortal soul have i met well nigh crushed and smothered under its load creeping down the road of life pushing before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty its augean stables never cleansed and one hundred acres of land tillage mowing pasture and wood-lot the portionless who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.\n",
      "but men labor under a mistake.\n",
      "the better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost.\n",
      "by a seeming fate commonly called necessity they are employed as it says in an old book laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal.\n",
      "it is a fools life as they will find when they get to the end of it if not before.\n",
      "it is said that deucalion and pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind them—      inde genus durum sumus experiensque laborum      et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati.\n",
      "or as raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way—      from thence our kind hard-hearted is enduring pain and care      approving that our bodies of a stony nature are.\n",
      " so much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle throwing the stones over their heads behind them and not seeing where they fell.\n",
      "most men even in this comparatively free country through mere ignorance and mistake are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\n",
      "their fingers from excessive toil are too clumsy and tremble too much for that.\n",
      "actually the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men his labor would be depreciated in the market.\n",
      "he has no time to be anything but a machine.\n",
      "how can he remember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often to use his knowledge.\n",
      "we should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes and recruit him with our cordials before we judge of him.\n",
      "the finest qualities of our nature like the bloom on fruits can be preserved only by the most delicate handling.\n",
      "yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.\n",
      "some of you we all know are poor find it hard to live are sometimes as it were gasping for breath.\n",
      "i have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time robbing your creditors of an hour.\n",
      "it is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live for my sight has been whetted by experience always on the limits trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt a very ancient slough called by the latins æs alienum anothers brass for some of their coins were made of brass still living and dying and buried by this others brass always promising to pay promising to pay tomorrow and dying today insolvent seeking to curry favor to get custom by how many modes only not state-prison offences lying flattering voting contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes or his hat or his coat or his carriage or import his groceries for him making yourselves sick that you may lay up something against a sick day something to be tucked away in an old chest or in a stocking behind the plastering or more safely in the brick bank no matter where no matter how much or how little.\n",
      "i sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous i may almost say as to attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called negro slavery there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south.\n",
      "it is hard to have a southern overseer it is worse to have a northern one but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself.\n",
      "talk of a divinity in man look at the teamster on the highway wending to market by day or night does any divinity stir within him.\n",
      "his highest duty to fodder and water his horses what is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests.\n",
      "does not he drive for squire make-a-stir.\n",
      "how godlike how immortal is he.\n",
      "see how he cowers and sneaks how vaguely all the day he fears not being immortal nor divine but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself a fame won by his own deeds.\n",
      "public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion.\n",
      "what a man thinks of himself that it is which determines or rather indicates his fate.\n",
      "self-emancipation even in the west indian provinces of the fancy and imagination—what wilberforce is there to bring that about.\n",
      "think also of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day not to betray too green an interest in their fates as if you could kill time without injuring eternity.\n",
      "the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\n",
      "what is called resignation is confirmed desperation.\n",
      "from the desperate city you go into the desperate country and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats.\n",
      "a stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind.\n",
      "there is no play in them for this comes after work.\n",
      "but it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.\n",
      "when we consider what to use the words of the catechism is the chief end of man and what are the true necessaries and means of life it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other.\n",
      "yet they honestly think there is no choice left.\n",
      "but alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear.\n",
      "it is never too late to give up our prejudices.\n",
      "no way of thinking or doing however ancient can be trusted without proof.\n",
      "what everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow mere smoke of opinion which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields.\n",
      "what old people say you cannot do you try and find that you can.\n",
      "old deeds for old people and new deeds for new.\n",
      "old people did not know enough once perchance to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going new people put a little dry wood under a pot and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds in a way to kill old people as the phrase is.\n",
      "age is no better hardly so well qualified for an instructor as youth for it has not profited so much as it has lost.\n",
      "one may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of absolute value by living.\n",
      "practically the old have no very important advice to give the young their own experience has been so partial and their lives have been such miserable failures for private reasons as they must believe and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience and they are only less young than they were.\n",
      "i have lived some thirty years on this planet and i have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors.\n",
      "they have told me nothing and probably cannot tell me any thing to the purpose.\n",
      "here is life an experiment to a great extent untried by me but it does not avail me that they have tried it.\n",
      "if i have any experience which i think valuable i am sure to reflect that this my mentors said nothing about.\n",
      "one farmer says to me you cannot live on vegetable food solely for it furnishes nothing to make bones with and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones walking all the while he talks behind his oxen which with vegetable-made bones jerk him and his lumbering plough along in spite of every obstacle.\n",
      "some things are really necessaries of life in some circles the most helpless and diseased which in others are luxuries merely and in others still are entirely unknown.\n",
      "the whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their predecessors both the heights and the valleys and all things to have been cared for.\n",
      "according to evelyn the wise solomon prescribed ordinances for the very distances of trees and the roman prætors have decided how often you may go into your neighbors land to gather the acorns which fall on it without trespass and what share belongs to that neighbor.\n",
      " hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut our nails that is even with the ends of the fingers neither shorter nor longer.\n",
      "undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as adam.\n",
      "but mans capacities have never been measured nor are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents so little has been tried.\n",
      "whatever have been thy failures hitherto be not afflicted my child for who shall assign to thee what thou hast left undone.\n",
      " we might try our lives by a thousand simple tests as for instance that the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of earths like ours.\n",
      "if i had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes.\n",
      "this was not the light in which i hoed them.\n",
      "the stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles what distant and different beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the same one at the same moment nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions.\n",
      "who shall say what prospect life offers to another.\n",
      "could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each others eyes for an instant.\n",
      "we should live in all the ages of the world in an hour ay in all the worlds of the ages.\n",
      "history poetry mythology—i know of no reading of anothers experience so startling and informing as this would be.\n",
      "the greater part of what my neighbors call good i believe in my soul to be bad and if i repent of anything it is very likely to be my good behavior.\n",
      "what demon possessed me that i behaved so well.\n",
      "you may say the wisest thing you can old man—you who have lived seventy years not without honor of a kind—i hear an irresistible voice which invites me away from all that.\n",
      "one generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels.\n",
      "i think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do.\n",
      "we may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere.\n",
      "nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength.\n",
      "the incessant anxiety and strain of some is a well nigh incurable form of disease.\n",
      "we are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do and yet how much is not done by us or what if we had been taken sick.\n",
      "how vigilant we are determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it all the day long on the alert at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties.\n",
      "so thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live reverencing our life and denying the possibility of change.\n",
      "this is the only way we say but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre.\n",
      "all change is a miracle to contemplate but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant.\n",
      "confucius said to know that we know what we know and that we do not know what we do not know that is true knowledge.\n",
      " when one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his understanding i foresee that all men at length establish their lives on that basis.\n",
      " let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which i have referred to is about and how much it is necessary that we be troubled or at least careful.\n",
      "it would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life though in the midst of an outward civilization if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them or even to look over the old day-books of the merchants to see what it was that men most commonly bought at the stores what they stored that is what are the grossest groceries.\n",
      "for the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of mans existence as our skeletons probably are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.\n",
      "by the words necessary of life i mean whatever of all that man obtains by his own exertions has been from the first or from long use has become so important to human life that few if any whether from savageness or poverty or philosophy ever attempt to do without it.\n",
      "to many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life food.\n",
      "to the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable grass with water to drink unless he seeks the shelter of the forest or the mountains shadow.\n",
      "none of the brute creation requires more than food and shelter.\n",
      "the necessaries of life for man in this climate may accurately enough be distributed under the several heads of food shelter clothing and fuel for not till we have secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of success.\n",
      "man has invented not only houses but clothes and cooked food and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire and the consequent use of it at first a luxury arose the present necessity to sit by it.\n",
      "we observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature.\n",
      "by proper shelter and clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat but with an excess of these or of fuel that is with an external heat greater than our own internal may not cookery properly be said to begin.\n",
      "darwin the naturalist says of the inhabitants of tierra del fuego that while his own party who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire were far from too warm these naked savages who were farther off were observed to his great surprise to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting.\n",
      " so we are told the new hollander goes naked with impunity while the european shivers in his clothes.\n",
      "is it impossible to combine the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man.\n",
      "according to liebig mans body is a stove and food the fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs.\n",
      "in cold weather we eat more in warm less.\n",
      "the animal heat is the result of a slow combustion and disease and death take place when this is too rapid or for want of fuel or from some defect in the draught the fire goes out.\n",
      "of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with fire but so much for analogy.\n",
      "it appears therefore from the above list that the expression animal life is nearly synonymous with the expression animal heat for while food may be regarded as the fuel which keeps up the fire within us—and fuel serves only to prepare that food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from without—shelter and clothing also serve only to retain the heat thus generated and absorbed.\n",
      "the grand necessity then for our bodies is to keep warm to keep the vital heat in us.\n",
      "what pains we accordingly take not only with our food and clothing and shelter but with our beds which are our night-clothes robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow the poor man is wont to complain that this is a cold world and to cold no less physical than social we refer directly a great part of our ails.\n",
      "the summer in some climates makes possible to man a sort of elysian life.\n",
      "fuel except to cook his food is then unnecessary the sun is his fire and many of the fruits are sufficiently cooked by its rays while food generally is more various and more easily obtained and clothing and shelter are wholly or half unnecessary.\n",
      "at the present day and in this country as i find by my own experience a few implements a knife an axe a spade a wheelbarrow &c.\n",
      "and for the studious lamplight stationery and access to a few books rank next to necessaries and can all be obtained at a trifling cost.\n",
      "yet some not wise go to the other side of the globe to barbarous and unhealthy regions and devote themselves to trade for ten or twenty years in order that they may live—that is keep comfortably warm—and die in new england at last.\n",
      "the luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm but unnaturally hot as i implied before they are cooked of course à la mode.\n",
      "most of the luxuries and many of the so called comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\n",
      "with respect to luxuries and comforts the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor.\n",
      "the ancient philosophers chinese hindoo persian and greek were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches none so rich in inward.\n",
      "we know not much about them.\n",
      "it is remarkable that we know so much of them as we do.\n",
      "the same is true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race.\n",
      "none can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty.\n",
      "of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury whether in agriculture or commerce or literature or art.\n",
      "there are nowadays professors of philosophy but not philosophers.\n",
      "yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live.\n",
      "to be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts nor even to found a school but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates a life of simplicity independence magnanimity and trust.\n",
      "it is to solve some of the problems of life not only theoretically but practically.\n",
      "the success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success not kingly not manly.\n",
      "they make shift to live merely by conformity practically as their fathers did and are in no sense the progenitors of a nobler race of men.\n",
      "but why do men degenerate ever.\n",
      "what makes families run out.\n",
      "what is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations.\n",
      "are we sure that there is none of it in our own lives.\n",
      "the philosopher is in advance of his age even in the outward form of his life.\n",
      "he is not fed sheltered clothed warmed like his contemporaries.\n",
      "how can a man be a philosopher and not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men.\n",
      "when a man is warmed by the several modes which i have described what does he want next.\n",
      "surely not more warmth of the same kind as more and richer food larger and more splendid houses finer and more abundant clothing more numerous incessant and hotter fires and the like.\n",
      "when he has obtained those things which are necessary to life there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities and that is to adventure on life now his vacation from humbler toil having commenced.\n",
      "the soil it appears is suited to the seed for it has sent its radicle downward and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence.\n",
      "why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above.\n",
      "—for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light far from the ground and are not treated like the humbler esculents which though they may be biennials are cultivated only till they have perfected their root and often cut down at top for this purpose so that most would not know them in their flowering season.\n",
      "i do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures who will mind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell and perchance build more magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest without ever impoverishing themselves not knowing how they live—if indeed there are any such as has been dreamed nor to those who find their encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present condition of things and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of lovers—and to some extent i reckon myself in this number i do not speak to those who are well employed in whatever circumstances and they know whether they are well employed or not—but mainly to the mass of men who are discontented and idly complaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times when they might improve them.\n",
      "there are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably of any because they are as they say doing their duty.\n",
      "i also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy but most terribly impoverished class of all who have accumulated dross but know not how to use it or get rid of it and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.\n",
      " if i should attempt to tell how i have desired to spend my life in years past it would probably surprise those of my readers who are somewhat acquainted with its actual history it would certainly astonish those who know nothing about it.\n",
      "i will only hint at some of the enterprises which i have cherished.\n",
      "in any weather at any hour of the day or night i have been anxious to improve the nick of time and notch it on my stick too to stand on the meeting of two eternities the past and future which is precisely the present moment to toe that line.\n",
      "you will pardon some obscurities for there are more secrets in my trade than in most mens and yet not voluntarily kept but inseparable from its very nature.\n",
      "i would gladly tell all that i know about it and never paint no admittance on my gate.\n",
      "i long ago lost a hound a bay horse and a turtle-dove and am still on their trail.\n",
      "many are the travellers i have spoken concerning them describing their tracks and what calls they answered to.\n",
      "i have met one or two who had heard the hound and the tramp of the horse and even seen the dove disappear behind a cloud and they seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had lost them themselves.\n",
      "to anticipate not the sunrise and the dawn merely but if possible nature herself how many mornings summer and winter before yet any neighbor was stirring about his business have i been about mine no doubt many of my townsmen have met me returning from this enterprise farmers starting for boston in the twilight or woodchoppers going to their work.\n",
      "it is true i never assisted the sun materially in his rising but doubt not it was of the last importance only to be present at it.\n",
      "so many autumn ay and winter days spent outside the town trying to hear what was in the wind to hear and carry it express i well-nigh sunk all my capital in it and lost my own breath into the bargain running in the face of it.\n",
      "if it had concerned either of the political parties depend upon it it would have appeared in the gazette with the earliest intelligence.\n",
      "at other times watching from the observatory of some cliff or tree to telegraph any new arrival or waiting at evening on the hill-tops for the sky to fall that i might catch something though i never caught much and that manna-wise would dissolve again in the sun.\n",
      "for a long time i was reporter to a journal of no very wide circulation whose editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions and as is too common with writers i got only my labor for my pains.\n",
      "however in this case my pains were their own reward.\n",
      "for many years i was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain storms and did my duty faithfully surveyor if not of highways then of forest paths and all across-lot routes keeping them open and ravines bridged and passable at all seasons where the public heel had testified to their utility.\n",

      "in the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants but i think that i speak within bounds when i say that though the birds of the air have their nests and the foxes their holes and the savages their wigwams in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a shelter.\n",
      "in the large towns and cities where civilization especially prevails the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole.\n",

      "if it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man—and i think that it is though only the wise improve their advantages—it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly and the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run.\n",
      "an average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborers life even if he is not encumbered with a family—estimating the pecuniary value of every mans labor at one dollar a day for if some receive more others receive less—so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will be earned.\n",

      "nevertheless this points to an important distinction between the civilized man and the savage and no doubt they have designs on us for our benefit in making the life of a civilized people an institution in which the life of the individual is to a great extent absorbed in order to preserve and perfect that of the race.\n",

      "—that our furniture should be more complex than the arabs in proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors at present our houses are cluttered and defiled with it and a good housewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole and not leave her mornings work undone.\n",

      "i cannot but perceive that this so called rich and refined life is a thing jumped at and i do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts which adorn it my attention being wholly occupied with the jump for i remember that the greatest genuine leap due to human muscles alone on record is that of certain wandering arabs who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground.\n",

      "old johnson in his wonder-working providence speaking of the first settlers of this town with whom he was contemporary tells us that they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some hillside and casting the soil aloft upon timber they make a smoky fire against the earth at the highest side.\n",

      " the secretary of the province of new netherland writing in dutch in 1650 for the information of those who wished to take up land there states more particularly that those in new netherland and especially in new england who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to their wishes dig a square pit in the ground cellar fashion six or seven feet deep as long and as broad as they think proper case the earth inside with wood all round the wall and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth floor this cellar with plank and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling raise a roof of spars clear up and cover the spars with bark or green sods so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their entire families for two three and four years it being understood that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the size of the family.\n",
      "the wealthy and principal men in new england in the beginning of the colonies commenced their first dwelling houses in this fashion for two reasons firstly in order not to waste time in building and not to want food the next season secondly in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbers from fatherland.\n",
      "in the course of three or four years when the country became adapted to agriculture they built themselves handsome houses spending on them several thousands.\n",
      " in this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at least as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants first.\n",
      "but are the more pressing wants satisfied now.\n",
      "when i think of acquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings i am deterred for so to speak the country is not yet adapted to human culture and we are still forced to cut our spiritual bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten.\n",
      "not that all architectural ornament is to be neglected even in the rudest periods but let our houses first be lined with beauty where they come in contact with our lives like the tenement of the shellfish and not overlaid with it.\n",
      "but alas i have been inside one or two of them and know what they are lined with.\n",
      "though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a cave or a wigwam or wear skins today it certainly is better to accept the advantages though so dearly bought which the invention and industry of mankind offer.\n",
      "in such a neighborhood as this boards and shingles lime and bricks are cheaper and more easily obtained than suitable caves or whole logs or bark in sufficient quantities or even well-tempered clay or flat stones.\n",

      "with a little more wit we might use these materials so as to become richer than the richest now are and make our civilization a blessing.\n",
      "the civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage.\n",
      "but to make haste to my own experiment.\n",
      " near the end of march 1845 i borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by walden pond nearest to where i intended to build my house and began to cut down some tall arrowy white pines still in their youth for timber.\n",
      "it is difficult to begin without borrowing but perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men to have an interest in your enterprise.\n",
      "the owner of the axe as he released his hold on it said that it was the apple of his eye but i returned it sharper than i received it.\n",
      "it was a pleasant hillside where i worked covered with pine woods through which i looked out on the pond and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were springing up.\n",
      "the ice in the pond was not yet dissolved though there were some open spaces and it was all dark colored and saturated with water.\n",
      "there were some slight flurries of snow during the days that i worked there but for the most part when i came out on to the railroad on my way home its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere and the rails shone in the spring sun and i heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us.\n",
      "they were pleasant spring days in which the winter of mans discontent was thawing as well as the earth and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself.\n",
      "one day when my axe had come off and i had cut a green hickory for a wedge driving it with a stone and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to swell the wood i saw a striped snake run into the water and he lay on the bottom apparently without inconvenience as long as i stayed there or more than a quarter of an hour perhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state.\n",
      "it appeared to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life.\n",
      "i had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible waiting for the sun to thaw them.\n",
      "on the 1st of april it rained and melted the ice and in the early part of the day which was very foggy i heard a stray goose groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost or like the spirit of the fog.\n",
      "so i went on for some days cutting and hewing timber and also studs and rafters all with my narrow axe not having many communicable or scholar-like thoughts singing to myself—      men say they know many things      but lo they have taken wings—      the arts and sciences      and a thousand appliances      the wind that blows      is all that any body knows.\n",
      "i hewed the main timbers six inches square most of the studs on two sides only and the rafters and floor timbers on one side leaving the rest of the bark on so that they were just as straight and much stronger than sawed ones.\n",
      "each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump for i had borrowed other tools by this time.\n",
      "my days in the woods were not very long ones yet i usually carried my dinner of bread and butter and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped at noon sitting amid the green pine boughs which i had cut off and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance for my hands were covered with a thick coat of pitch.\n",
      "before i had done i was more the friend than the foe of the pine tree though i had cut down some of them having become better acquainted with it.\n",
      "sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted by the sound of my axe and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which i had made.\n",
      "by the middle of april for i made no haste in my work but rather made the most of it my house was framed and ready for the raising.\n",
      "i had already bought the shanty of james collins an irishman who worked on the fitchburg railroad for boards.\n",
      "james collins shanty was considered an uncommonly fine one.\n",
      "when i called to see it he was not at home.\n",
      "i walked about the outside at first unobserved from within the window was so deep and high.\n",
      "it was of small dimensions with a peaked cottage roof and not much else to be seen the dirt being raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap.\n",
      "the roof was the soundest part though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun.\n",
      "door-sill there was none but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board.\n",
      "mrs.\n",
      "c.\n",
      "came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside.\n",
      "the hens were driven in by my approach.\n",
      "it was dark and had a dirt floor for the most part dank clammy and aguish only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal.\n",
      "she lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls and also that the board floor extended under the bed warning me not to step into the cellar a sort of dust hole two feet deep.\n",
      "in her own words they were good boards overhead good boards all around and a good window—of two whole squares originally only the cat had passed out that way lately.\n",
      "there was a stove a bed and a place to sit an infant in the house where it was born a silk parasol gilt-framed looking-glass and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling all told.\n",
      "the bargain was soon concluded for james had in the meanwhile returned.\n",
      "i to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents to-night he to vacate at five to-morrow morning selling to nobody else meanwhile i to take possession at six.\n",
      "it were well he said to be there early and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel.\n",
      "this he assured me was the only encumbrance.\n",
      "at six i passed him and his family on the road.\n",
      "one large bundle held their all—bed coffee-mill looking-glass hens—all but the cat she took to the woods and became a wild cat and as i learned afterward trod in a trap set for woodchucks and so became a dead cat at last.\n",
      "i took down this dwelling the same morning drawing the nails and removed it to the pond side by small cartloads spreading the boards on the grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun.\n",
      "one early thrush gave me a note or two as i drove along the woodland path.\n",
      "i was informed treacherously by a young patrick that neighbor seeley an irishman in the intervals of the carting transferred the still tolerable straight and drivable nails staples and spikes to his pocket and then stood when i came back to pass the time of day and look freshly up unconcerned with spring thoughts at the devastation there being a dearth of work as he said.\n",
      "he was there to represent spectatordom and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of troy.\n",
      "i dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south where a woodchuck had formerly dug his burrow down through sumach and blackberry roots and the lowest stain of vegetation six feet square by seven deep to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in any winter.\n",
      "the sides were left shelving and not stoned but the sun having never shone on them the sand still keeps its place.\n",
      "it was but two hours work.\n",
      "i took particular pleasure in this breaking of ground for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable temperature.\n",
      "under the most splendid house in the city is still to be found the cellar where they store their roots as of old and long after the superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth.\n",
      "the house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow.\n",
      "at length in the beginning of may with the help of some of my acquaintances rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity i set up the frame of my house.\n",
      "no man was ever more honored in the character of his raisers than i.\n",
      "they are destined i trust to assist at the raising of loftier structures one day.\n",
      "i began to occupy my house on the 4th of july as soon as it was boarded and roofed for the boards were carefully feather-edged and lapped so that it was perfectly impervious to rain but before boarding i laid the foundation of a chimney at one end bringing two cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms.\n",
      "i built the chimney after my hoeing in the fall before a fire became necessary for warmth doing my cooking in the mean while out of doors on the ground early in the morning which mode i still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than the usual one.\n",
      "when it stormed before my bread was baked i fixed a few boards over the fire and sat under them to watch my loaf and passed some pleasant hours in that way.\n",
      "in those days when my hands were much employed i read but little but the least scraps of paper which lay on the ground my holder or tablecloth afforded me as much entertainment in fact answered the same purpose as the iliad.\n",
      " it would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than i did considering for instance what foundation a door a window a cellar a garret have in the nature of man and perchance never raising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it than our temporal necessities even.\n",
      "there is some of the same fitness in a mans building his own house that there is in a birds building its own nest.\n",
      "who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough the poetic faculty would be universally developed as birds universally sing when they are so engaged.\n",
      "but alas we do like cowbirds and cuckoos which lay their eggs in nests which other birds have built and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical notes.\n",
      "shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter.\n",
      "what does architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men.\n",
      "i never in all my walks came across a man engaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house.\n",
      "we belong to the community.\n",
      "it is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man it is as much the preacher and the merchant and the farmer.\n",
      "where is this division of labor to end.\n",
      "and what object does it finally serve.\n",
      "no doubt another may also think for me but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.\n",
      "true there are architects so called in this country and i have heard of one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core of truth a necessity and hence a beauty as if it were a revelation to him.\n",
      "all very well perhaps from his point of view but only a little better than the common dilettantism.\n",
      "a sentimental reformer in architecture he began at the cornice not at the foundation.\n",
      "it was only how to put a core of truth within the ornaments that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond or caraway seed in it—though i hold that almonds are most wholesome without the sugar—and not how the inhabitant the indweller might build truly within and without and let the ornaments take care of themselves.\n",
      "what reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the skin merely—that the tortoise got his spotted shell or the shellfish its mother-o-pearl tints by such a contract as the inhabitants of broadway their trinity church.\n",
      "but a man has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard.\n",
      "the enemy will find it out.\n",
      "he may turn pale when the trial comes.\n",
      "this man seemed to me to lean over the cornice and timidly whisper his half truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he.\n",
      "what of architectural beauty i now see i know has gradually grown from within outward out of the necessities and character of the indweller who is the only builder—out of some unconscious truthfulness and nobleness without ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of life.\n",
      "the most interesting dwellings in this country as the painter knows are the most unpretending humble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly it is the life of the inhabitants whose shells they are and not any peculiarity in their surfaces merely which makes them picturesque and equally interesting will be the citizens suburban box when his life shall be as simple and as agreeable to the imagination and there is as little straining after effect in the style of his dwelling.\n",
      "a great proportion of architectural ornaments are literally hollow and a september gale would strip them off like borrowed plumes without injury to the substantials.\n",
      "they can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar.\n",
      "what if an equal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature and the architects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the architects of our churches do.\n",
      "so are made the belles-lettres and the beaux-arts and their professors.\n",
      "much it concerns a man forsooth how a few sticks are slanted over him or under him and what colors are daubed upon his box.\n",
      "it would signify somewhat if in any earnest sense he slanted them and daubed it but the spirit having departed out of the tenant it is of a piece with constructing his own coffin—the architecture of the grave and carpenter is but another name for coffin-maker.\n",
      " one man says in his despair or indifference to life take up a handful of the earth at your feet and paint your house that color.\n",
      "is he thinking of his last and narrow house.\n",
      "toss up a copper for it as well.\n",
      "what an abundance of leisure he must have why do you take up a handful of dirt.\n",
      "better paint your house your own complexion let it turn pale or blush for you.\n",
      "an enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture when you have got my ornaments ready i will wear them.\n",
      "before winter i built a chimney and shingled the sides of my house which were already impervious to rain with imperfect and sappy shingles made of the first slice of the log whose edges i was obliged to straighten with a plane.\n",
      "i have thus a tight shingled and plastered house ten feet wide by fifteen long and eight-feet posts with a garret and a closet a large window on each side two trap doors one door at the end and a brick fireplace opposite.\n",
      "the exact cost of my house paying the usual price for such materials as i used but not counting the work all of which was done by myself was as follows and i give the details because very few are able to tell exactly what their houses cost and fewer still if any the separate cost of the various materials which compose them—      boards.\n",

      "to meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers i may as well state that if i dined out occasionally as i always had done and i trust shall have opportunities to do again it was frequently to the detriment of my domestic arrangements.\n",
      "but the dining out being as i have stated a constant element does not in the least affect a comparative statement like this.\n",
      "i learned from my two years experience that it would cost incredibly little trouble to obtain ones necessary food even in this latitude that a man may use as simple a diet as the animals and yet retain health and strength.\n",

      "i tried flour also but have at last found a mixture of rye and indian meal most convenient and agreeable.\n",
      "in cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession tending and turning them as carefully as an egyptian his hatching eggs.\n",
      "they were a real cereal fruit which i ripened and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits which i kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths.\n",
      "i made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making consulting such authorities as offered going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which it is supposed taught the leavening process and through the various fermentations thereafter till i came to good sweet wholesome bread the staff of life.\n",
      "leaven which some deem the soul of bread the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire—some precious bottle-full i suppose first brought over in the mayflower did the business for america and its influence is still rising swelling spreading in cerealian billows over the land—this seed i regularly and faithfully procured from the village till at length one morning i forgot the rules and scalded my yeast by which accident i discovered that even this was not indispensable—for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process—and i have gladly omitted it since though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces.\n",
      "yet i find it not to be an essential ingredient and after going without it for a year am still in the land of the living and i am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture.\n",

      "yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that in concord fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops and hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any.\n",
      "for the most part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own producing and buys flour which is at least no more wholesome at a greater cost at the store.\n",
      "i saw that i could easily raise my bushel or two of rye and indian corn for the former will grow on the poorest land and the latter does not require the best and grind them in a hand-mill and so do without rice and pork and if i must have some concentrated sweet i found by experiment that i could make a very good molasses either of pumpkins or beets and i knew that i needed only to set out a few maples to obtain it more easily still and while these were growing i could use various substitutes beside those which i have named.\n",
      "for as the forefathers sang—      we can make liquor to sweeten our lips      of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips.\n",
      " finally as for salt that grossest of groceries to obtain this might be a fit occasion for a visit to the seashore or if i did without it altogether i should probably drink the less water.\n",
      "i do not learn that the indians ever troubled themselves to go after it.\n",
      "thus i could avoid all trade and barter so far as my food was concerned and having a shelter already it would only remain to get clothing and fuel.\n",
      "the pantaloons which i now wear were woven in a farmers family—thank heaven there is so much virtue still in man for i think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great and memorable as that from the man to the farmer—and in a new country fuel is an encumbrance.\n",
      "as for a habitat if i were not permitted still to squat i might purchase one acre at the same price for which the land i cultivated was sold—namely eight dollars and eight cents.\n",
      "but as it was i considered that i enhanced the value of the land by squatting on it.\n",
      "there is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such questions as if i think that i can live on vegetable food alone and to strike at the root of the matter at once—for the root is faith—i am accustomed to answer such that i can live on board nails.\n",
      "if they cannot understand that they cannot understand much that i have to say.\n",
      "for my part i am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried as that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard raw corn on the ear using his teeth for all mortar.\n",
      "the squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded.\n",
      "the human race is interested in these experiments though a few old women who are incapacitated for them or who own their thirds in mills may be alarmed.\n",
      " my furniture part of which i made myself and the rest cost me nothing of which i have not rendered an account consisted of a bed a table a desk three chairs a looking-glass three inches in diameter a pair of tongs and andirons a kettle a skillet and a frying-pan a dipper a wash-bowl two knives and forks three plates one cup one spoon a jug for oil a jug for molasses and a japanned lamp.\n",
      "none is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin.\n",
      "that is shiftlessness.\n",

      "what man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men a beggarly account of empty boxes.\n",
      "that is spauldings furniture.\n",
      "i could never tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so called rich man or a poor one the owner always seemed poverty-stricken.\n",
      "indeed the more you have of such things the poorer you are.\n",
      "each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties and if one shanty is poor this is a dozen times as poor.\n",
      "pray for what do we move ever but to get rid of our furniture our exuviæ at last to go from this world to another newly furnished and leave this to be burned.\n",
      "it is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a mans belt and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are cast without dragging them—dragging his trap.\n",
      "he was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap.\n",

      " if you are a seer whenever you meet a man you will see all that he owns ay and much that he pretends to disown behind him even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can.\n",
      "i think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knot hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him.\n",
      "i cannot but feel compassion when i hear some trig compact-looking man seemingly free all girded and ready speak of his furniture as whether it is insured or not.\n",

      "throw away the first three at least.\n",
      "it would surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk and i should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run.\n",
      "when i have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all—looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck—i have pitied him not because that was his all but because he had all that to carry.\n",
      "if i have got to drag my trap i will take care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part.\n",
      "but perchance it would be wisest never to put ones paw into it.\n",
      "i would observe by the way that it costs me nothing for curtains for i have no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon and i am willing that they should look in.\n",
      "the moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine nor will the sun injure my furniture or fade my carpet and if he is sometimes too warm a friend i find it still better economy to retreat behind some curtain which nature has provided than to add a single item to the details of housekeeping.\n",

      "among the rest was a dried tapeworm.\n",
      "and now after lying half a century in his garret and other dust holes these things were not burned instead of a bonfire or purifying destruction of them there was an auction or increasing of them.\n",

      "when a town celebrates the busk says he having previously provided themselves with new clothes new pots pans and other household utensils and furniture they collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things sweep and cleanse their houses squares and the whole town of their filth which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they cast together into one common heap and consume it with fire.\n",
      "after having taken medicine and fasted for three days all the fire in the town is extinguished.\n",
      "during this fast they abstain from the gratification of every appetite and passion whatever.\n",
      "a general amnesty is proclaimed all malefactors may return to their town.\n",
      "— on the fourth morning the high priest by rubbing dry wood together produces new fire in the public square from whence every habitation in the town is supplied with the new and pure flame.\n",
      " they then feast on the new corn and fruits and dance and sing for three days and the four following days they receive visits and rejoice with their friends from neighboring towns who have in like manner purified and prepared themselves.\n",
      " the mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every fifty-two years in the belief that it was time for the world to come to an end.\n",
      "i have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament that is as the dictionary defines it outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace than this and i have no doubt that they were originally inspired directly from heaven to do thus though they have no biblical record of the revelation.\n",
      " for more than five years i maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands and i found that by working about six weeks in a year i could meet all the expenses of living.\n",
      "the whole of my winters as well as most of my summers i had free and clear for study.\n",
      "i have thoroughly tried school-keeping and found that my expenses were in proportion or rather out of proportion to my income for i was obliged to dress and train not to say think and believe accordingly and i lost my time into the bargain.\n",
      "as i did not teach for the good of my fellow-men but simply for a livelihood this was a failure.\n",
      "i have tried trade but i found that it would take ten years to get under way in that and that then i should probably be on my way to the devil.\n",
      "i was actually afraid that i might by that time be doing what is called a good business.\n",
      "when formerly i was looking about to see what i could do for a living some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity i thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries that surely i could do and its small profits might suffice—for my greatest skill has been to want but little—so little capital it required so little distraction from my wonted moods i foolishly thought.\n",
      "while my acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions i contemplated this occupation as most like theirs ranging the hills all summer to pick the berries which came in my way and thereafter carelessly dispose of them so to keep the flocks of admetus.\n",
      "i also dreamed that i might gather the wild herbs or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods even to the city by hay-cart loads.\n",
      "but i have since learned that trade curses everything it handles and though you trade in messages from heaven the whole curse of trade attaches to the business.\n",
      "as i preferred some things to others and especially valued my freedom as i could fare hard and yet succeed well i did not wish to spend my time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture or delicate cookery or a house in the grecian or the gothic style just yet.\n",
      "if there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things and who know how to use them when acquired i relinquish to them the pursuit.\n",
      "some are industrious and appear to love labor for its own sake or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief to such i have at present nothing to say.\n",
      "those who would not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy i might advise to work twice as hard as they do—work till they pay for themselves and get their free papers.\n",
      "for myself i found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the most independent of any especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one.\n",
      "the laborers day ends with the going down of the sun and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit independent of his labor but his employer who speculates from month to month has no respite from one end of the year to the other.\n",
      "in short i am convinced both by faith and experience that to maintain ones self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime if we will live simply and wisely as the pursuits of the simpler nations are still the sports of the more artificial.\n",

      "one young man of my acquaintance who has inherited some acres told me that he thought he should live as i did if he had the means.\n",
      "i would not have any one adopt my mode of living on any account for beside that before he has fairly learned it i may have found out another for myself i desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible but i would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way and not his fathers or his mothers or his neighbors instead.\n",

      "we may not arrive at our port within a calculable period but we would preserve the true course.\n",
      "undoubtedly in this case what is true for one is truer still for a thousand as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one since one roof may cover one cellar underlie and one wall separate several apartments.\n",
      "but for my part i preferred the solitary dwelling.\n",
      "moreover it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall and when you have done this the common partition to be much cheaper must be a thin one and that other may prove a bad neighbor and also not keep his side in repair.\n",
      "the only coöperation which is commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial and what little true coöperation there is is as if it were not being a harmony inaudible to men.\n",
      "if a man has faith he will coöperate with equal faith everywhere if he has not faith he will continue to live like the rest of the world whatever company he is joined to.\n",
      "to coöperate in the highest as well as the lowest sense means to get our living together.\n",
      "i heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel together over the world the one without money earning his means as he went before the mast and behind the plow the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket.\n",
      "it was easy to see that they could not long be companions or coöperate since one would not operate at all.\n",
      "they would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures.\n",
      "above all as i have implied the man who goes alone can start to-day but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready and it may be a long time before they get off.\n",
      " but all this is very selfish i have heard some of my townsmen say.\n",
      "i confess that i have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic enterprises.\n",
      "i have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty and among others have sacrificed this pleasure also.\n",
      "there are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some poor family in the town and if i had nothing to do—for the devil finds employment for the idle—i might try my hand at some such pastime as that.\n",
      "however when i have thought to indulge myself in this respect and lay their heaven under an obligation by maintaining certain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as i maintain myself and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer they have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor.\n",
      "while my townsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of their fellows i trust that one at least may be spared to other and less humane pursuits.\n",
      "you must have a genius for charity as well as for any thing else.\n",
      "as for doing-good that is one of the professions which are full.\n",
      "moreover i have tried it fairly and strange as it may seem am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution.\n",
      "probably i should not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me to save the universe from annihilation and i believe that a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it.\n",
      "but i would not stand between any man and his genius and to him who does this work which i decline with his whole heart and soul and life i would say persevere even if the world call it doing evil as it is most likely they will.\n",
      "i am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one no doubt many of my readers would make a similar defence.\n",
      "at doing something—i will not engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good—i do not hesitate to say that i should be a capital fellow to hire but what that is it is for my employer to find out.\n",
      "what good i do in the common sense of that word must be aside from my main path and for the most part wholly unintended.\n",
      "men say practically begin where you are and such as you are without aiming mainly to become of more worth and with kindness aforethought go about doing good.\n",
      "if i were to preach at all in this strain i should say rather set about being good.\n",
      "as if the sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude and go about like a robin goodfellow peeping in at every cottage window inspiring lunatics and tainting meats and making darkness visible instead of steadily increasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can look him in the face and then and in the mean while too going about the world in his own orbit doing it good or rather as a truer philosophy has discovered the world going about him getting good.\n",
      "when phaeton wishing to prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence had the suns chariot but one day and drove out of the beaten track he burned several blocks of houses in the lower streets of heaven and scorched the surface of the earth and dried up every spring and made the great desert of sahara till at length jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt and the sun through grief at his death did not shine for a year.\n",

      "my imagination carried me so far that i even had the refusal of several farms—the refusal was all i wanted—but i never got my fingers burned by actual possession.\n",

      "the real attractions of the hollowell farm to me were its complete retirement being about two miles from the village half a mile from the nearest neighbor and separated from the highway by a broad field its bounding on the river which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring though that was nothing to me the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn and the dilapidated fences which put such an interval between me and the last occupant the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees gnawed by rabbits showing what kind of neighbors i should have but above all the recollection i had of it from my earliest voyages up the river when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples through which i heard the house-dog bark.\n",

      "this was an airy and unplastered cabin fit to entertain a travelling god and where a goddess might trail her garments.\n",
      "the winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains bearing the broken strains or celestial parts only of terrestrial music.\n",
      "the morning wind forever blows the poem of creation is uninterrupted but few are the ears that hear it.\n",
      "olympus is but the outside of the earth every where.\n",
      "the only house i had been the owner of before if i except a boat was a tent which i used occasionally when making excursions in the summer and this is still rolled up in my garret but the boat after passing from hand to hand has gone down the stream of time.\n",
      "with this more substantial shelter about me i had made some progress toward settling in the world.\n",
      "this frame so slightly clad was a sort of crystallization around me and reacted on the builder.\n",
      "it was suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines.\n",
      "i did not need to go outdoors to take the air for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness.\n",
      "it was not so much within doors as behind a door where i sat even in the rainiest weather.\n",
      "the harivansa says an abode without birds is like a meat without seasoning.\n",
      " such was not my abode for i found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds not by having imprisoned one but having caged myself near them.\n",
      "i was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never or rarely serenade a villager—the wood-thrush the veery the scarlet tanager the field-sparrow the whippoorwill and many others.\n",
      "i was seated by the shore of a small pond about a mile and a half south of the village of concord and somewhat higher than it in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and lincoln and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame concord battle ground but i was so low in the woods that the opposite shore half a mile off like the rest covered with wood was my most distant horizon.\n",
      "for the first week whenever i looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain its bottom far above the surface of other lakes and as the sun arose i saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist and here and there by degrees its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed while the mists like ghosts were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle.\n",
      "the very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day than usual as on the sides of mountains.\n",
      "this small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rain storm in august when both air and water being perfectly still but the sky overcast mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening and the wood-thrush sang around and was heard from shore to shore.\n",
      "a lake like this is never smoother than at such a time and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds the water full of light and reflections becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important.\n",
      "from a hill top near by where the wood had been recently cut off there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley but stream there was none.\n",
      "that way i looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon tinged with blue.\n",
      "indeed by standing on tiptoe i could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the north-west those true-blue coins from heavens own mint and also of some portion of the village.\n",
      "but in other directions even from this point i could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me.\n",
      "it is well to have some water in your neighborhood to give buoyancy to and float the earth.\n",
      "one value even of the smallest well is that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular.\n",
      "this is as important as that it keeps butter cool.\n",
      "when i looked across the pond from this peak toward the sudbury meadows which in time of flood i distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley like a coin in a basin all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water and i was reminded that this on which i dwelt was but dry land.\n",
      "though the view from my door was still more contracted i did not feel crowded or confined in the least.\n",
      "there was pasture enough for my imagination.\n",
      "the low shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore arose stretched away toward the prairies of the west and the steppes of tartary affording ample room for all the roving families of men.\n",
      "there are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast horizon—said damodara when his herds required new and larger pastures.\n",
      "both place and time were changed and i dwelt nearer to those parts of the universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me.\n",
      "where i lived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly by astronomers.\n",
      "we are wont to imagine rare and delectable places in some remote and more celestial corner of the system behind the constellation of cassiopeias chair far from noise and disturbance.\n",
      "i discovered that my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn but forever new and unprofaned part of the universe.\n",
      "if it were worth the while to settle in those parts near to the pleiades or the hyades to aldebaran or altair then i was really there or at an equal remoteness from the life which i had left behind dwindled and twinkling with as fine a ray to my nearest neighbor and to be seen only in moonless nights by him.\n",
      "such was that part of creation where i had squatted—      there was a shepherd that did live          and held his thoughts as high      as were the mounts whereon his flocks          did hourly feed him by.\n",
      " what should we think of the shepherds life if his flocks always wandered to higher pastures than his thoughts.\n",
      "every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity and i may say innocence with nature herself.\n",
      "i have been as sincere a worshipper of aurora as the greeks.\n",
      "i got up early and bathed in the pond that was a religious exercise and one of the best things which i did.\n",
      "they say that characters were engraven on the bathing tub of king tching-thang to this effect renew thyself completely each day do it again and again and forever again.\n",
      " i can understand that.\n",
      "morning brings back the heroic ages.\n",
      "i was as much affected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible and unimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn when i was sitting with door and windows open as i could be by any trumpet that ever sang of fame.\n",
      "it was homers requiem itself an iliad and odyssey in the air singing its own wrath and wanderings.\n",
      "there was something cosmical about it a standing advertisement till forbidden of the everlasting vigor and fertility of the world.\n",
      "the morning which is the most memorable season of the day is the awakening hour.\n",
      "then there is least somnolence in us and for an hour at least some part of us awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night.\n",
      "little is to be expected of that day if it can be called a day to which we are not awakened by our genius but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within accompanied by the undulations of celestial music instead of factory bells and a fragrance filling the air—to a higher life than we fell asleep from and thus the darkness bear its fruit and prove itself to be good no less than the light.\n",
      "that man who does not believe that each day contains an earlier more sacred and auroral hour than he has yet profaned has despaired of life and is pursuing a descending and darkening way.\n",
      "after a partial cessation of his sensuous life the soul of man or its organs rather are reinvigorated each day and his genius tries again what noble life it can make.\n",

      "i know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.\n",

      "i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived.\n",
      "i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary.\n",
      "i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.\n",

      "the nation itself with all its so called internal improvements which by the way are all external and superficial is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury and heedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as the million households in the land and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy a stern and more than spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose.\n",
      "it lives too fast.\n",
      "men think that it is essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubt whether they do or not but whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain.\n",
      "if we do not get out sleepers and forge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them who will build railroads.\n",
      "and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season.\n",
      "but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads.\n",

      "and every few years a new lot is laid down and run over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail others have the misfortune to be ridden upon.\n",
      "and when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hue and cry about it as if this were an exception.\n",
      "i am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again.\n",

      "as for spain for instance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta and don pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the right proportions—they may have changed the names a little since i saw the papers—and serve up a bull-fight when other entertainments fail it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or ruin of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649 and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year you never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character.\n",

      "it was pleasant to see my whole household effects out on the grass making a little pile like a gypsys pack and my three-legged table from which i did not remove the books and pen and ink standing amid the pines and hickories.\n",

      "near the end of may the sand-cherry cerasus pumila adorned the sides of the path with its delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems which last in the fall weighed down with good sized and handsome cherries fell over in wreaths like rays on every side.\n",

      "the whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter sounding like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmers yard informing me that many restless city merchants are arriving within the circle of the town or adventurous country traders from the other side.\n",

      "when i meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary motion—or rather like a comet for the beholder knows not if with that velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system since its orbit does not look like a returning curve—with its steam cloud like a banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths like many a downy cloud which i have seen high in the heavens unfolding its masses to the light—as if this travelling demigod this cloud-compeller would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery of his train when i hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his snort like thunder shaking the earth with his feet and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon they will put into the new mythology i dont know it seems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it.\n",
      "if all were as it seems and men made the elements their servants for noble ends if the cloud that hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds or as beneficent as that which floats over the farmers fields then the elements and nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their errands and be their escort.\n",

      "their train of clouds stretching far behind and rising higher and higher going to heaven while the cars are going to boston conceals the sun for a minute and casts my distant field into the shade a celestial train beside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but the barb of the spear.\n",

      "all day the fire-steed flies over the country stopping only that his master may rest and i am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at midnight when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow and he will reach his stall only with the morning star to start once more on his travels without rest or slumber.\n",
      "or perchance at evening i hear him in his stable blowing off the superfluous energy of the day that he may calm his nerves and cool his liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber.\n",
      "if the enterprise were as heroic and commanding as it is protracted and unwearied far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns where once only the hunter penetrated by day in the darkest night dart these bright saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants this moment stopping at some brilliant station-house in town or city where a social crowd is gathered the next in the dismal swamp scaring the owl and fox.\n",

      "on this morning of the great snow perchance which is still raging and chilling mens blood i hear the muffled tone of their engine bell from out the fog bank of their chilled breath which announces that the cars are coming without long delay notwithstanding the veto of a new england north-east snow storm and i behold the ploughmen covered with snow and rime their heads peering above the mould-board which is turning down other than daisies and the nests of field-mice like bowlders of the sierra nevada that occupy an outside place in the universe.\n",

      "sometimes on sundays i heard the bells the lincoln acton bedford or concord bell when the wind was favorable a faint sweet and as it were natural melody worth importing into the wilderness.\n",
      "at a sufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain vibratory hum as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept.\n",
      "all sound heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect a vibration of the universal lyre just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it.\n",
      "there came to me in this case a melody which the air had strained and which had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood that portion of the sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from vale to vale.\n",
      "the echo is to some extent an original sound and therein is the magic and charm of it.\n",
      "it is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in the bell but partly the voice of the wood the same trivial words and notes sung by a wood-nymph.\n",
      "at evening the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the woods sounded sweet and melodious and at first i would mistake it for the voices of certain minstrels by whom i was sometimes serenaded who might be straying over hill and dale but soon i was not unpleasantly disappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music of the cow.\n",
      "i do not mean to be satirical but to express my appreciation of those youths singing when i state that i perceived clearly that it was akin to the music of the cow and they were at length one articulation of nature.\n",
      "regularly at half past seven in one part of the summer after the evening train had gone by the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for half an hour sitting on a stump by my door or upon the ridge pole of the house.\n",
      "they would begin to sing almost with as much precision as a clock within five minutes of a particular time referred to the setting of the sun every evening.\n",
      "i had a rare opportunity to become acquainted with their habits.\n",
      "sometimes i heard four or five at once in different parts of the wood by accident one a bar behind another and so near me that i distinguished not only the cluck after each note but often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spiders web only proportionally louder.\n",
      "sometimes one would circle round and round me in the woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string when probably i was near its eggs.\n",
      "they sang at intervals throughout the night and were again as musical as ever just before and about dawn.\n",
      "when other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain like mourning women their ancient u-lu-lu.\n",
      "their dismal scream is truly ben jonsonian.\n",

      "yet i love to hear their wailing their doleful responses trilled along the wood-side reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds as if it were the dark and tearful side of music the regrets and sighs that would fain be sung.\n",
      "they are the spirits the low spirits and melancholy forebodings of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the earth and did the deeds of darkness now expiating their sins with their wailing hymns or threnodies in the scenery of their transgressions.\n",
      "they give me a new sense of the variety and capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling.\n",
      "oh-o-o-o-o that i never had been bor-r-r-r-n sighs one on this side of the pond and circles with the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks.\n",
      "then—that i never had been bor-r-r-r-n echoes another on the farther side with tremulous sincerity and—bor-r-r-r-n comes faintly from far in the lincoln woods.\n",
      "i was also serenaded by a hooting owl.\n",
      "near at hand you could fancy it the most melancholy sound in nature as if she meant by this to stereotype and make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human being—some poor weak relic of mortality who has left hope behind and howls like an animal yet with human sobs on entering the dark valley made more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness—i find myself beginning with the letters gl when i try to imitate it—expressive of a mind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy stage in the mortification of all healthy and courageous thought.\n",
      "it reminded me of ghouls and idiots and insane howlings.\n",
      "but now one answers from far woods in a strain made really melodious by distance—hoo hoo hoo hoorer hoo and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing associations whether heard by day or night summer or winter.\n",
      "i rejoice that there are owls.\n",
      "let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for men.\n",
      "it is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day illustrates suggesting a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not recognized.\n",
      "they represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have.\n",
      "all day the sun has shone on the surface of some savage swamp where the single spruce stands hung with usnea lichens and small hawks circulate above and the chickadee lisps amid the evergreens and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneath but now a more dismal and fitting day dawns and a different race of creatures awakes to express the meaning of nature there.\n",
      "late in the evening i heard the distant rumbling of wagons over bridges—a sound heard farther than almost any other at night—the baying of dogs and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn-yard.\n",
      "in the mean while all the shore rang with the trump of bullfrogs the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers still unrepentant trying to sing a catch in their stygian lake—if the walden nymphs will pardon the comparison for though there are almost no weeds there are frogs there—who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave mocking at mirth and the wine has lost its flavor and become only liquor to distend their paunches and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention.\n",
      "the most aldermanic with his chin upon a heart-leaf which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water and passes round the cup with the ejaculation tr-r-r-oonk tr-r-r-oonk tr-r-r-oonk and straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark and when this observance has made the circuit of the shores then ejaculates the master of ceremonies with satisfaction tr-r-r-oonk and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended leakiest and flabbiest paunched that there be no mistake and then the bowl goes round again and again until the sun disperses the morning mist and only the patriarch is not under the pond but vainly bellowing troonk from time to time and pausing for a reply.\n",
      "i am not sure that i ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my clearing and i thought that it might be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music merely as a singing bird.\n",
      "the note of this once wild indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any birds and if they could be naturalized without being domesticated it would soon become the most famous sound in our woods surpassing the clangor of the goose and the hooting of the owl and then imagine the cackling of the hens to fill the pauses when their lords clarions rested no wonder that man added this bird to his tame stock—to say nothing of the eggs and drumsticks.\n",
      "to walk in a winter morning in a wood where these birds abounded their native woods and hear the wild cockerels crow on the trees clear and shrill for miles over the resounding earth drowning the feebler notes of other birds—think of it it would put nations on the alert.\n",
      "who would not be early to rise and rise earlier and earlier every successive day of his life till he became unspeakably healthy wealthy and wise.\n",
      "this foreign birds note is celebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their native songsters.\n",
      "all climates agree with brave chanticleer.\n",
      "he is more indigenous even than the natives.\n",
      "his health is ever good his lungs are sound his spirits never flag.\n",
      "even the sailor on the atlantic and pacific is awakened by his voice but its shrill sound never roused me from my slumbers.\n",
      "i kept neither dog cat cow pig nor hens so that you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds neither the churn nor the spinning wheel nor even the singing of the kettle nor the hissing of the urn nor children crying to comfort one.\n",
      "an old-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died of ennui before this.\n",
      "not even rats in the wall for they were starved out or rather were never baited in—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor a whippoorwill on the ridge pole a blue-jay screaming beneath the window a hare or woodchuck under the house a screech-owl or a cat-owl behind it a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond and a fox to bark in the night.\n",
      "not even a lark or an oriole those mild plantation birds ever visited my clearing.\n",
      "no cockerels to crow nor hens to cackle in the yard.\n",
      "no yard but unfenced nature reaching up to your very sills.\n",
      "a young forest growing up under your meadows and wild sumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of room their roots reaching quite under the house.\n",
      "instead of a scuttle or a blind blown off in the gale—a pine tree snapped off or torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel.\n",
      "instead of no path to the front-yard gate in the great snow—no gate—no front-yard—and no path to the civilized world  solitude this is a delicious evening when the whole body is one sense and imbibes delight through every pore.\n",
      "i go and come with a strange liberty in nature a part of herself.\n",
      "as i walk along the stony shore of the pond in my shirt sleeves though it is cool as well as cloudy and windy and i see nothing special to attract me all the elements are unusually congenial to me.\n",
      "the bullfrogs trump to usher in the night and the note of the whippoorwill is borne on the rippling wind from over the water.\n",
      "sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar leaves almost takes away my breath yet like the lake my serenity is rippled but not ruffled.\n",
      "these small waves raised by the evening wind are as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface.\n",
      "though it is now dark the wind still blows and roars in the wood the waves still dash and some creatures lull the rest with their notes.\n",
      "the repose is never complete.\n",
      "the wildest animals do not repose but seek their prey now the fox and skunk and rabbit now roam the fields and woods without fear.\n",
      "they are natures watchmen—links which connect the days of animated life.\n",
      "when i return to my house i find that visitors have been there and left their cards either a bunch of flowers or a wreath of evergreen or a name in pencil on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip.\n",
      "they who come rarely to the woods take some little piece of the forest into their hands to play with by the way which they leave either intentionally or accidentally.\n",
      "one has peeled a willow wand woven it into a ring and dropped it on my table.\n",
      "i could always tell if visitors had called in my absence either by the bended twigs or grass or the print of their shoes and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by some slight trace left as a flower dropped or a bunch of grass plucked and thrown away even as far off as the railroad half a mile distant or by the lingering odor of a cigar or pipe.\n",
      "nay i was frequently notified of the passage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods off by the scent of his pipe.\n",
      "there is commonly sufficient space about us.\n",
      "our horizon is never quite at our elbows.\n",
      "the thick wood is not just at our door nor the pond but somewhat is always clearing familiar and worn by us appropriated and fenced in some way and reclaimed from nature.\n",
      "for what reason have i this vast range and circuit some square miles of unfrequented forest for my privacy abandoned to me by men.\n",
      "my nearest neighbor is a mile distant and no house is visible from any place but the hill-tops within half a mile of my own.\n",
      "i have my horizon bounded by woods all to myself a distant view of the railroad where it touches the pond on the one hand and of the fence which skirts the woodland road on the other.\n",
      "but for the most part it is as solitary where i live as on the prairies.\n",
      "it is as much asia or africa as new england.\n",
      "i have as it were my own sun and moon and stars and a little world all to myself.\n",
      "at night there was never a traveller passed my house or knocked at my door more than if i were the first or last man unless it were in the spring when at long intervals some came from the village to fish for pouts—they plainly fished much more in the walden pond of their own natures and baited their hooks with darkness—but they soon retreated usually with light baskets and left the world to darkness and to me and the black kernel of the night was never profaned by any human neighborhood.\n",
      "i believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark though the witches are all hung and christianity and candles have been introduced.\n",
      "yet i experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender the most innocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural object even for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man.\n",
      "there can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of nature and has his senses still.\n",
      "there was never yet such a storm but it was æolian music to a healthy and innocent ear.\n",
      "nothing can rightly compel a simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness.\n",
      "while i enjoy the friendship of the seasons i trust that nothing can make life a burden to me.\n",
      "the gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day is not drear and melancholy but good for me too.\n",
      "though it prevents my hoeing them it is of far more worth than my hoeing.\n",
      "if it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands it would still be good for the grass on the uplands and being good for the grass it would be good for me.\n",
      "sometimes when i compare myself with other men it seems as if i were more favored by the gods than they beyond any deserts that i am conscious of as if i had a warrant and surety at their hands which my fellows have not and were especially guided and guarded.\n",
      "i do not flatter myself but if it be possible they flatter me.\n",
      "i have never felt lonesome or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude but once and that was a few weeks after i came to the woods when for an hour i doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life.\n",
      "to be alone was something unpleasant.\n",
      "but i was at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood and seemed to foresee my recovery.\n",
      "in the midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed i was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in nature in the very pattering of the drops and in every sound and sight around my house an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me as made the fancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant and i have never thought of them since.\n",
      "every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me.\n",
      "i was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to me even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary and also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest was not a person nor a villager that i thought no place could ever be strange to me again.\n",
      "—      mourning untimely consumes the sad      few are their days in the land of the living      beautiful daughter of toscar.\n",
      " some of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain storms in the spring or fall which confined me to the house for the afternoon as well as the forenoon soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting when an early twilight ushered in a long evening in which many thoughts had time to take root and unfold themselves.\n",
      "in those driving north-east rains which tried the village houses so when the maids stood ready with mop and pail in front entries to keep the deluge out i sat behind my door in my little house which was all entry and thoroughly enjoyed its protection.\n",
      "in one heavy thunder shower the lightning struck a large pitch-pine across the pond making a very conspicuous and perfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom an inch or more deep and four or five inches wide as you would groove a walking-stick.\n",
      "i passed it again the other day and was struck with awe on looking up and beholding that mark now more distinct than ever where a terrific and resistless bolt came down out of the harmless sky eight years ago.\n",
      "men frequently say to me i should think you would feel lonesome down there and want to be nearer to folks rainy and snowy days and nights especially.\n",
      " i am tempted to reply to such—this whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space.\n",
      "how far apart think you dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments.\n",

      "i have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another.\n",
      "what do we want most to dwell near to.\n",
      "not to many men surely the depot the post-office the bar-room the meeting-house the school-house the grocery beacon hill or the five points where men most congregate but to the perennial source of our life whence in all our experience we have found that to issue as the willow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that direction.\n",
      "this will vary with different natures but this is the place where a wise man will dig his cellar.\n",

      ".\n",
      "i one evening overtook one of my townsmen who has accumulated what is called a handsome property—though i never got a fair view of it—on the walden road driving a pair of cattle to market who inquired of me how i could bring my mind to give up so many of the comforts of life.\n",
      "i answered that i was very sure i liked it passably well i was not joking.\n",

      " he was a skilful chopper and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments in his art.\n",
      "he cut his trees level and close to the ground that the sprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might slide over the stumps and instead of leaving a whole tree to support his corded wood he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter which you could break off with your hand at last.\n",
      "he interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes.\n",
      "his mirth was without alloy.\n",
      "sometimes i saw him at his work in the woods felling trees and he would greet me with a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction and a salutation in canadian french though he spoke english as well.\n",

      "such an exuberance of animal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the ground with laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him.\n",
      "looking round upon the trees he would exclaim—by george i can enjoy myself well enough here chopping i want no better sport.\n",
      " sometimes when at leisure he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket pistol firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked.\n",
      "in the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a kettle and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in his fingers and he said that he liked to have the little fellers about him.\n",

      " but the intellectual and what is called spiritual man in him were slumbering as in an infant.\n",
      "he had been instructed only in that innocent and ineffectual way in which the catholic priests teach the aborigines by which the pupil is never educated to the degree of consciousness but only to the degree of trust and reverence and a child is not made a man but kept a child.\n",
      "when nature made him she gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion and propped him on every side with reverence and reliance that he might live out his threescore years and ten a child.\n",

      "men paid him wages for work and so helped to feed and clothe him but he never exchanged opinions with them.\n",

      "i asked him if he ever wished to write his thoughts.\n",
      "he said that he had read and written letters for those who could not but he never tried to write thoughts—no he could not he could not tell what to put first it would kill him and then there was spelling to be attended to at the same time i heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did not want the world to be changed but he answered with a chuckle of surprise in his canadian accent not knowing that the question had ever been entertained before no i like it well enough.\n",
      " it would have suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him.\n",
      "to a stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general yet i sometimes saw in him a man whom i had not seen before and i did not know whether he was as wise as shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a child whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of stupidity.\n",
      "a townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through the village in his small close-fitting cap and whistling to himself he reminded him of a prince in disguise.\n",
      "his only books were an almanac and an arithmetic in which last he was considerably expert.\n",

      "he had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it and thought that was better than water in warm weather.\n",
      "when i asked him if he could do without money he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin of this institution and the very derivation of the word pecunia.\n",
      "if an ox were his property and he wished to get needles and thread at the store he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount.\n",
      "he could defend many institutions better than any philosopher because in describing them as they concerned him he gave the true reason for their prevalence and speculation had not suggested to him any other.\n",
      "at another time hearing platos definition of a man—a biped without feathers—and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it platos man he thought it an important difference that the knees bent the wrong way.\n",
      "he would sometimes exclaim how i love to talk by george i could talk all day i asked him once when i had not seen him for many months if he had got a new idea this summer.\n",

      "satisfied said he some men are satisfied with one thing and some with another.\n",
      "one man perhaps if he has got enough will be satisfied to sit all day with his back to the fire and his belly to the table by george yet i never by any manœuvring could get him to take the spiritual view of things the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple expediency such as you might expect an animal to appreciate and this practically is true of most men.\n",
      "if i suggested any improvement in his mode of life he merely answered without expressing any regret that it was too late.\n",
      "yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like virtues.\n",
      "there was a certain positive originality however slight to be detected in him and i occasionally observed that he was thinking for himself and expressing his own opinion a phenomenon so rare that i would any day walk ten miles to observe it and it amounted to the re-origination of many of the institutions of society.\n",
      "though he hesitated and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly he always had a presentable thought behind.\n",
      "yet his thinking was so primitive and immersed in his animal life that though more promising than a merely learned mans it rarely ripened to any thing which can be reported.\n",
      "he suggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades of life however permanently humble and illiterate who take their own view always or do not pretend to see at all who are as bottomless even as walden pond was thought to be though they may be dark and muddy.\n",
      " many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my house and as an excuse for calling asked for a glass of water.\n",

      "with respect to wit i learned that there was not much difference between the half and the whole.\n",
      "one day in particular an inoffensive simple-minded pauper whom with others i had often seen used as fencing stuff standing or sitting on a bushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying visited me and expressed a wish to live as i did.\n",

      "but why should i raise them.\n",
      "only heaven knows.\n",

      "soon however the remaining beans will be too tough for them and go forward to meet new foes.\n",
      "when i was four years old as i well remember i was brought from boston to this my native town through these very woods and this field to the pond.\n",
      "it is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory.\n",
      "and now to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water.\n",
      "the pines still stand here older than i or if some have fallen i have cooked my supper with their stumps and a new growth is rising all around preparing another aspect for new infant eyes.\n",
      "almost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture and even i have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my infant dreams and one of the results of my presence and influence is seen in these bean leaves corn blades and potato vines.\n",
      "i planted about two acres and a half of upland and as it was only about fifteen years since the land was cleared and i myself had got out two or three cords of stumps i did not give it any manure but in the course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which i turned up in hoeing that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here and planted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land and so to some extent had exhausted the soil for this very crop.\n",
      "before yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road or the sun had got above the shrub oaks while all the dew was on though the farmers warned me against it—i would advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on—i began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads.\n",
      "early in the morning i worked barefooted dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crumbling sand but later in the day the sun blistered my feet.\n",
      "there the sun lighted me to hoe beans pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland between the long green rows fifteen rods the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where i could rest in the shade the other in a blackberry field where the green berries deepened their tints by the time i had made another bout.\n",
      "removing the weeds putting fresh soil about the bean stems and encouraging this weed which i had sown making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass making the earth say beans instead of grass—this was my daily work.\n",
      "as i had little aid from horses or cattle or hired men or boys or improved implements of husbandry i was much slower and became much more intimate with my beans than usual.\n",
      "but labor of the hands even when pursued to the verge of drudgery is perhaps never the worst form of idleness.\n",
      "it has a constant and imperishable moral and to the scholar it yields a classic result.\n",
      "a very agricola laboriosus was i to travellers bound westward through lincoln and wayland to nobody knows where they sitting at their ease in gigs with elbows on knees and reins loosely hanging in festoons i the home-staying laborious native of the soil.\n",
      "but soon my homestead was out of their sight and thought.\n",
      "it was the only open and cultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road so they made the most of it and sometimes the man in the field heard more of travellers gossip and comment than was meant for his ear beans so late peas so late—for i continued to plant when others had begun to hoe—the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it.\n",
      "corn my boy for fodder corn for fodder.\n",
      " does he live there.\n",
      " asks the black bonnet of the gray coat and the hard-featured farmer reins up his grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the furrow and recommends a little chip dirt or any little waste stuff or it may be ashes or plaster.\n",
      "but here were two acres and a half of furrows and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw it—there being an aversion to other carts and horses—and chip dirt far away.\n",
      "fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with the fields which they had passed so that i came to know how i stood in the agricultural world.\n",
      "this was one field not in mr.\n",
      "colemans report.\n",
      "and by the way who estimates the value of the crop which nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man.\n",
      "the crop of english hay is carefully weighed the moisture calculated the silicates and the potash but in all dells and pond holes in the woods and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man.\n",
      "mine was as it were the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields as some states are civilized and others half-civilized and others savage or barbarous so my field was though not in a bad sense a half-cultivated field.\n",
      "they were beans cheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that i cultivated and my hoe played the ranz des vaches for them.\n",
      "near at hand upon the topmost spray of a birch sings the brown-thrasher—or red mavis as some love to call him—all the morning glad of your society that would find out another farmers field if yours were not here.\n",
      "while you are planting the seed he cries—drop it drop it—cover it up cover it up—pull it up pull it up pull it up.\n",
      " but this was not corn and so it was safe from such enemies as he.\n",
      "you may wonder what his rigmarole his amateur paganini performances on one string or on twenty have to do with your planting and yet prefer it to leached ashes or plaster.\n",
      "it was a cheap sort of top dressing in which i had entire faith.\n",
      "as i drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe i disturbed the ashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under these heavens and their small implements of war and hunting were brought to the light of this modern day.\n",
      "they lay mingled with other natural stones some of which bore the marks of having been burned by indian fires and some by the sun and also bits of pottery and glass brought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil.\n",
      "when my hoe tinkled against the stones that music echoed to the woods and the sky and was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and immeasurable crop.\n",
      "it was no longer beans that i hoed nor i that hoed beans and i remembered with as much pity as pride if i remembered at all my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios.\n",
      "the night-hawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoons—for i sometimes made a day of it—like a mote in the eye or in heavens eye falling from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent torn at last to very rags and tatters and yet a seamless cope remained small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the ground on bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills where few have found them graceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond as leaves are raised by the wind to float in the heavens such kindredship is in nature.\n",
      "the hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and surveys those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the elemental unfledged pinions of the sea.\n",
      "or sometimes i watched a pair of hen-hawks circling high in the sky alternately soaring and descending approaching and leaving one another as if they were the embodiment of my own thoughts.\n",
      "or i was attracted by the passage of wild pigeons from this wood to that with a slight quivering winnowing sound and carrier haste or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned up a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander a trace of egypt and the nile yet our contemporary.\n",
      "when i paused to lean on my hoe these sounds and sights i heard and saw anywhere in the row a part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers.\n",
      "on gala days the town fires its great guns which echo like popguns to these woods and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate thus far.\n",
      "to me away there in my bean-field at the other end of the town the big guns sounded as if a puffball had burst and when there was a military turnout of which i was ignorant i have sometimes had a vague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in the horizon as if some eruption would break out there soon either scarlatina or canker-rash until at length some more favorable puff of wind making haste over the fields and up the wayland road brought me information of the trainers.\n",
      " it seemed by the distant hum as if somebodys bees had swarmed and that the neighbors according to virgils advice by a faint tintinnabulum upon the most sonorous of their domestic utensils were endeavoring to call them down into the hive again.\n",
      "and when the sound died quite away and the hum had ceased and the most favorable breezes told no tale i knew that they had got the last drone of them all safely into the middlesex hive and that now their minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared.\n",
      "i felt proud to know that the liberties of massachusetts and of our fatherland were in such safe keeping and as i turned to my hoeing again i was filled with an inexpressible confidence and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.\n",
      "when there were several bands of musicians it sounded as if all the village was a vast bellows and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately with a din.\n",
      "but sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that reached these woods and the trumpet that sings of fame and i felt as if i could spit a mexican with a good relish—for why should we always stand for trifles.\n",
      "—and looked round for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon.\n",
      "these martial strains seemed as far away as palestine and reminded me of a march of crusaders in the horizon with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion of the elm-tree tops which overhang the village.\n",
      "this was one of the great days though the sky had from my clearing only the same everlastingly great look that it wears daily and i saw no difference in it.\n",
      "it was a singular experience that long acquaintance which i cultivated with beans what with planting and hoeing and harvesting and threshing and picking over and selling them—the last was the hardest of all—i might add eating for i did taste.\n",
      "i was determined to know beans.\n",
      "when they were growing i used to hoe from five oclock in the morning till noon and commonly spent the rest of the day about other affairs.\n",
      "consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes with various kinds of weeds—it will bear some iteration in the account for there was no little iteration in the labor—disturbing their delicate organizations so ruthlessly and making such invidious distinctions with his hoe levelling whole ranks of one species and sedulously cultivating another.\n",
      "thats roman wormwood—thats pigweed—thats sorrel—thats piper-grass—have at him chop him up turn his roots upward to the sun dont let him have a fibre in the shade if you do hell turn himself tother side up and be as green as a leek in two days.\n",
      "a long war not with cranes but with weeds those trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their side.\n",
      "daily the beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe and thin the ranks of their enemies filling up the trenches with weedy dead.\n",
      "many a lusty crest-waving hector that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades fell before my weapon and rolled in the dust.\n",
      "those summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine arts in boston or rome and others to contemplation in india and others to trade in london or new york i thus with the other farmers of new england devoted to husbandry.\n",
      "not that i wanted beans to eat for i am by nature a pythagorean so far as beans are concerned whether they mean porridge or voting and exchanged them for rice but perchance as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes and expression to serve a parable-maker one day.\n",
      "it was on the whole a rare amusement which continued too long might have become a dissipation.\n",
      "though i gave them no manure and did not hoe them all once i hoed them unusually well as far as i went and was paid for it in the end there being in truth as evelyn says no compost or lætation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion repastination and turning of the mould with the spade.\n",
      " the earth he adds elsewhere especially if fresh has a certain magnetism in it by which it attracts the salt power or virtue call it either which gives it life and is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep about it to sustain us all dungings and other sordid temperings being but the vicars succedaneous to this improvement.\n",
      " moreover this being one of those worn-out and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath had perchance as sir kenelm digby thinks likely attracted vital spirits from the air.\n",
      "i harvested twelve bushels of beans.\n",

      "this is the result of my experience in raising beans.\n",
      "plant the common small white bush bean about the first of june in rows three feet by eighteen inches apart being careful to select fresh round and unmixed seed.\n",
      "first look out for worms and supply vacancies by planting anew.\n",
      "then look out for woodchucks if it is an exposed place for they will nibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go and again when the young tendrils make their appearance they have notice of it and will shear them off with both buds and young pods sitting erect like a squirrel.\n",
      "but above all harvest as early as possible if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop you may save much loss by this means.\n",
      "this further experience also i gained.\n",
      "i said to myself i will not plant beans and corn with so much industry another summer but such seeds if the seed is not lost as sincerity truth simplicity faith innocence and the like and see if they will not grow in this soil even with less toil and manurance and sustain me for surely it has not been exhausted for these crops.\n",
      "alas i said this to myself but now another summer is gone and another and another and i am obliged to say to you reader that the seeds which i planted if indeed they were the seeds of those virtues were wormeaten or had lost their vitality and so did not come up.\n",
      "commonly men will only be brave as their fathers were brave or timid.\n",
      "this generation is very sure to plant corn and beans each new year precisely as the indians did centuries ago and taught the first settlers to do as if there were a fate in it.\n",
      "i saw an old man the other day to my astonishment making the holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least and not for himself to lie down in but why should not the new englander try new adventures and not lay so much stress on his grain his potato and grass crop and his orchards—raise other crops than these.\n",
      "why concern ourselves so much about our beans for seed and not be concerned at all about a new generation of men.\n",
      "we should really be fed and cheered if when we met a man we were sure to see that some of the qualities which i have named which we all prize more than those other productions but which are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air had taken root and grown in him.\n",
      "here comes such a subtile and ineffable quality for instance as truth or justice though the slightest amount or new variety of it along the road.\n",
      "our ambassadors should be instructed to send home such seeds as these and congress help to distribute them over all the land.\n",
      "we should never stand upon ceremony with sincerity.\n",
      "we should never cheat and insult and banish one another by our meanness if there were present the kernel of worth and friendliness.\n",
      "we should not meet thus in haste.\n",
      "most men i do not meet at all for they seem not to have time they are busy about their beans.\n",
      "we would not deal with a man thus plodding ever leaning on a hoe or a spade as a staff between his work not as a mushroom but partially risen out of the earth something more than erect like swallows alighted and walking on the ground—      and as he spake his wings would now and then      spread as he meant to fly then close again so that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel.\n",
      "bread may not always nourish us but it always does us good it even takes stiffness out of our joints and makes us supple and buoyant when we knew not what ailed us to recognize any generosity in man or nature to share any unmixed and heroic joy.\n",
      "ancient poetry and mythology suggest at least that husbandry was once a sacred art but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness by us our object being to have large farms and large crops merely.\n",
      "we have no festival nor procession nor ceremony not excepting our cattle-shows and so called thanksgivings by which the farmer expresses a sense of the sacredness of his calling or is reminded of its sacred origin.\n",
      "it is the premium and the feast which tempt him.\n",
      "he sacrifices not to ceres and the terrestrial jove but to the infernal plutus rather.\n",
      "by avarice and selfishness and a grovelling habit from which none of us is free of regarding the soil as property or the means of acquiring property chiefly the landscape is deformed husbandry is degraded with us and the farmer leads the meanest of lives.\n",
      "he knows nature but as a robber.\n",
      "cato says that the profits of agriculture are particularly pious or just maximeque pius quæstus and according to varro the old romans called the same earth mother and ceres and thought that they who cultivated it led a pious and useful life and that they alone were left of the race of king saturn.\n",
      " we are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction.\n",
      "they all reflect and absorb his rays alike and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course.\n",
      "in his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden.\n",
      "therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity.\n",
      "what though i value the seed of these beans and harvest that in the fall of the year.\n",
      "this broad field which i have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator but away from me to influences more genial to it which water and make it green.\n",
      "these beans have results which are not harvested by me.\n",
      "do they not grow for woodchucks partly.\n",
      "the ear of wheat in latin spica obsoletely speca from spe hope should not be the only hope of the husbandman its kernel or grain granum from gerendo bearing is not all that it bears.\n",
      "how then can our harvest fail.\n",
      "shall i not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds.\n",
      "it matters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmers barns.\n",
      "the true husbandman will cease from anxiety as the squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not and finish his labor with every day relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields and sacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also.\n",
      " the village after hoeing or perhaps reading and writing in the forenoon i usually bathed again in the pond swimming across one of its coves for a stint and washed the dust of labor from my person or smoothed out the last wrinkle which study had made and for the afternoon was absolutely free.\n",
      "every day or two i strolled to the village to hear some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there circulating either from mouth to mouth or from newspaper to newspaper and which taken in homœopathic doses was really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs.\n",
      "as i walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels so i walked in the village to see the men and boys instead of the wind among the pines i heard the carts rattle.\n",
      "in one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men as curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs each sitting at the mouth of its burrow or running over to a neighbors to gossip.\n",
      "i went there frequently to observe their habits.\n",
      "the village appeared to me a great news room and on one side to support it as once at redding & companys on state street they kept nuts and raisins or salt and meal and other groceries.\n",
      "some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity that is the news and such sound digestive organs that they can sit forever in public avenues without stirring and let it simmer and whisper through them like the etesian winds or as if inhaling ether it only producing numbness and insensibility to pain—otherwise it would often be painful to hear—without affecting the consciousness.\n",
      "i hardly ever failed when i rambled through the village to see a row of such worthies either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that from time to time with a voluptuous expression or else leaning against a barn with their hands in their pockets like caryatides as if to prop it up.\n",
      "they being commonly out of doors heard whatever was in the wind.\n",
      "these are the coarsest mills in which all gossip is first rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more delicate hoppers within doors.\n",
      "i observed that the vitals of the village were the grocery the bar-room the post-office and the bank and as a necessary part of the machinery they kept a bell a big gun and a fire-engine at convenient places and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of mankind in lanes and fronting one another so that every traveller had to run the gantlet and every man woman and child might get a lick at him.\n",
      "of course those who were stationed nearest to the head of the line where they could most see and be seen and have the first blow at him paid the highest prices for their places and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts where long gaps in the line began to occur and the traveller could get over walls or turn aside into cow paths and so escape paid a very slight ground or window tax.\n",
      "signs were hung out on all sides to allure him some to catch him by the appetite as the tavern and victualling cellar some by the fancy as the dry goods store and the jewellers and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts as the barber the shoemaker or the tailor.\n",
      "besides there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one of these houses and company expected about these times.\n",
      "for the most part i escaped wonderfully from these dangers either by proceeding at once boldly and without deliberation to the goal as is recommended to those who run the gantlet or by keeping my thoughts on high things like orpheus who loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre drowned the voices of the sirens and kept out of danger.\n",
      " sometimes i bolted suddenly and nobody could tell my whereabouts for i did not stand much about gracefulness and never hesitated at a gap in a fence.\n",
      "i was even accustomed to make an irruption into some houses where i was well entertained and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful of news what had subsided the prospects of war and peace and whether the world was likely to hold together much longer i was let out through the rear avenues and so escaped to the woods again.\n",
      "it was very pleasant when i stayed late in town to launch myself into the night especially if it was dark and tempestuous and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room with a bag of rye or indian meal upon my shoulder for my snug harbor in the woods having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts leaving only my outer man at the helm or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing.\n",
      "i had many a genial thought by the cabin fire as i sailed.\n",
      " i was never cast away nor distressed in any weather though i encountered some severe storms.\n",
      "it is darker in the woods even in common nights than most suppose.\n",
      "i frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route and where there was no cart-path to feel with my feet the faint track which i had worn or steer by the known relation of particular trees which i felt with my hands passing between two pines for instance not more than eighteen inches apart in the midst of the woods invariably in the darkest night.\n",
      "sometimes after coming home thus late in a dark and muggy night when my feet felt the path which my eyes could not see dreaming and absent-minded all the way until i was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch i have not been able to recall a single step of my walk and i have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake it as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance.\n",
      "several times when a visitor chanced to stay into evening and it proved a dark night i was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear of the house and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his eyes.\n",
      "one very dark night i directed thus on their way two young men who had been fishing in the pond.\n",
      "they lived about a mile off through the woods and were quite used to the route.\n",
      "a day or two after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night close by their own premises and did not get home till toward morning by which time as there had been several heavy showers in the mean while and the leaves were very wet they were drenched to their skins.\n",
      "i have heard of many going astray even in the village streets when the darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife as the saying is.\n",
      "some who live in the outskirts having come to town a-shopping in their wagons have been obliged to put up for the night and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way feeling the sidewalk only with their feet and not knowing when they turned.\n",
      "it is a surprising and memorable as well as valuable experience to be lost in the woods any time.\n",
      "often in a snow storm even by day one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it impossible to tell which way leads to the village.\n",
      "though he knows that he has travelled it a thousand times he cannot recognize a feature in it but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in siberia.\n",
      "by night of course the perplexity is infinitely greater.\n",
      "in our most trivial walks we are constantly though unconsciously steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape and not till we are completely lost or turned round—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lost—do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature.\n",
      "every man has to learn the points of compass again as often as he awakes whether from sleep or any abstraction.\n",
      "not till we are lost in other words not till we have lost the world do we begin to find ourselves and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.\n",
      "one afternoon near the end of the first summer when i went to the village to get a shoe from the cobblers i was seized and put into jail because as i have elsewhere related i did not pay a tax to or recognize the authority of the state which buys and sells men women and children like cattle at the door of its senate-house.\n",
      "i had gone down to the woods for other purposes.\n",
      "but wherever a man goes men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions and if they can constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society.\n",
      "it is true i might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect might have run amok against society but i preferred that society should run amok against me it being the desperate party.\n",
      "however i was released the next day obtained my mended shoe and returned to the woods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on fair-haven hill.\n",
      "i was never molested by any person but those who represented the state.\n",
      "i had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers not even a nail to put over my latch or windows.\n",
      "i never fastened my door night or day though i was to be absent several days not even when the next fall i spent a fortnight in the woods of maine.\n",
      "and yet my house was more respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers.\n",
      "the tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire the literary amuse himself with the few books on my table or the curious by opening my closet door see what was left of my dinner and what prospect i had of a supper.\n",
      "yet though many people of every class came this way to the pond i suffered no serious inconvenience from these sources and i never missed anything but one small book a volume of homer which perhaps was improperly gilded and this i trust a soldier of our camp has found by this time.\n",
      "i am convinced that if all men were to live as simply as i then did thieving and robbery would be unknown.\n",
      "these take place only in communities where some have got more than is sufficient while others have not enough.\n",
      "the popes homers would soon get properly distributed.\n",
      "—                      nec bella fuerunt      faginus astabat dum scyphus ante dapes.\n",
      "                      nor wars did men molest      when only beechen bowls were in request.\n",
      " you who govern public affairs what need have you to employ punishments.\n",
      "love virtue and the people will be virtuous.\n",
      "the virtues of a superior man are like the wind the virtues of a common man are like the grass the grass when the wind passes over it bends.\n",
      "  the ponds sometimes having had a surfeit of human society and gossip and worn out all my village friends i rambled still farther westward than i habitually dwell into yet more unfrequented parts of the town to fresh woods and pastures new or while the sun was setting made my supper of huckleberries and blueberries on fair haven hill and laid up a store for several days.\n",
      "the fruits do not yield their true flavor to the purchaser of them nor to him who raises them for the market.\n",
      "there is but one way to obtain it yet few take that way.\n",
      "if you would know the flavor of huckleberries ask the cow-boy or the partridge.\n",
      "it is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them.\n",
      "a huckleberry never reaches boston they have not been known there since they grew on her three hills.\n",
      "the ambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off in the market cart and they become mere provender.\n",
      "as long as eternal justice reigns not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither from the countrys hills.\n",
      "occasionally after my hoeing was done for the day i joined some impatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning as silent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf and after practising various kinds of philosophy had concluded commonly by the time i arrived that he belonged to the ancient sect of cœnobites.\n",
      "there was one older man an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds of woodcraft who was pleased to look upon my house as a building erected for the convenience of fishermen and i was equally pleased when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines.\n",
      "once in a while we sat together on the pond he at one end of the boat and i at the other but not many words passed between us for he had grown deaf in his later years but he occasionally hummed a psalm which harmonized well enough with my philosophy.\n",
      "our intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony far more pleasing to remember than if it had been carried on by speech.\n",
      "when as was commonly the case i had none to commune with i used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on the side of my boat filling the surrounding woods with circling and dilating sound stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts until i elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side.\n",
      "in warm evenings i frequently sat in the boat playing the flute and saw the perch which i seemed to have charmed hovering around me and the moon travelling over the ribbed bottom which was strewed with the wrecks of the forest.\n",
      "formerly i had come to this pond adventurously from time to time in dark summer nights with a companion and making a fire close to the waters edge which we thought attracted the fishes we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread and when we had done far in the night threw the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets which coming down into the pond were quenched with a loud hissing and we were suddenly groping in total darkness.\n",
      "through this whistling a tune we took our way to the haunts of men again.\n",
      "but now i had made my home by the shore.\n",
      "sometimes after staying in a village parlor till the family had all retired i have returned to the woods and partly with a view to the next days dinner spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight serenaded by owls and foxes and hearing from time to time the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand.\n",
      "these experiences were very memorable and valuable to me—anchored in forty feet of water and twenty or thirty rods from the shore surrounded sometimes by thousands of small perch and shiners dimpling the surface with their tails in the moonlight and communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as i drifted in the gentle night breeze now and then feeling a slight vibration along it indicative of some life prowling about its extremity of dull uncertain blundering purpose there and slow to make up its mind.\n",
      "at length you slowly raise pulling hand over hand some horned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air.\n",
      "it was very queer especially in dark nights when your thoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres to feel this faint jerk which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to nature again.\n",
      "it seemed as if i might next cast my line upward into the air as well as downward into this element which was scarcely more dense.\n",
      "thus i caught two fishes as it were with one hook.\n",
      " the scenery of walden is on a humble scale and though very beautiful does not approach to grandeur nor can it much concern one who has not long frequented it or lived by its shore yet this pond is so remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular description.\n",
      "it is a clear and deep green well half a mile long and a mile and three quarters in circumference and contains about sixty-one and a half acres a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak woods without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and evaporation.\n",
      "the surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the height of forty to eighty feet though on the south-east and east they attain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively within a quarter and a third of a mile.\n",
      "they are exclusively woodland.\n",
      "all our concord waters have two colors at least one when viewed at a distance and another more proper close at hand.\n",
      "the first depends more on the light and follows the sky.\n",
      "in clear weather in summer they appear blue at a little distance especially if agitated and at a great distance all appear alike.\n",
      "in stormy weather they are sometimes of a dark slate color.\n",
      "the sea however is said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere.\n",
      "i have seen our river when the landscape being covered with snow both water and ice were almost as green as grass.\n",
      "some consider blue to be the color of pure water whether liquid or solid.\n",
      " but looking directly down into our waters from a boat they are seen to be of very different colors.\n",
      "walden is blue at one time and green at another even from the same point of view.\n",
      "lying between the earth and the heavens it partakes of the color of both.\n",
      "viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand then a light green which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the pond.\n",
      "in some lights viewed even from a hill-top it is of a vivid green next the shore.\n",
      "some have referred this to the reflection of the verdure but it is equally green there against the railroad sand-bank and in the spring before the leaves are expanded and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand.\n",
      "such is the color of its iris.\n",
      "this is that portion also where in the spring the ice being warmed by the heat of the sun reflected from the bottom and also transmitted through the earth melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle.\n",
      "like the rest of our waters when much agitated in clear weather so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle or because there is more light mixed with it it appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself and at such a time being on its surface and looking with divided vision so as to see the reflection i have discerned a matchless and indescribable light blue such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest more cerulean than the sky itself alternating with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves which last appeared but muddy in comparison.\n",
      "it is a vitreous greenish blue as i remember it like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown.\n",
      "yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air.\n",
      "it is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint owing as the makers say to its body but a small piece of the same will be colorless.\n",
      "how large a body of walden water would be required to reflect a green tint i have never proved.\n",
      "the water of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it and like that of most ponds imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge but this water is of such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness still more unnatural which as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal produces a monstrous effect making fit studies for a michael angelo.\n",
      "the water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet.\n",
      "paddling over it you may see many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners perhaps only an inch long yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there.\n",
      "once in the winter many years ago when i had been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel as i stepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice but as if some evil genius had directed it it slid four or five rods directly into one of the holes where the water was twenty-five feet deep.\n",
      "out of curiosity i lay down on the ice and looked through the hole until i saw the axe a little on one side standing on its head with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off if i had not disturbed it.\n",
      "making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which i had and cutting down the longest birch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife i made a slip-noose which i attached to its end and letting it down carefully passed it over the knob of the handle and drew it by a line along the birch and so pulled the axe out again.\n",
      "the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving stones excepting one or two short sand beaches and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head and were it not for its remarkable transparency that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side.\n",
      "some think it is bottomless.\n",
      "it is nowhere muddy and a casual observer would say that there were no weeds at all in it and of noticeable plants except in the little meadows recently overflowed which do not properly belong to it a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush nor even a lily yellow or white but only a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons and perhaps a water-target or two all which however a bather might not perceive and these plants are clean and bright like the element they grow in.\n",
      "the stones extend a rod or two into the water and then the bottom is pure sand except in the deepest parts where there is usually a little sediment probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter.\n",
      "we have one other pond just like this white pond in nine acre corner about two and a half miles westerly but though i am acquainted with most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre i do not know a third of this pure and well-like character.\n",
      "successive nations perchance have drank at admired and fathomed it and passed away and still its water is green and pellucid as ever.\n",
      "not an intermitting spring perhaps on that spring morning when adam and eve were driven out of eden walden pond was already in existence and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind and covered with myriads of ducks and geese which had not heard of the fall when still such pure lakes sufficed them.\n",
      "even then it had commenced to rise and fall and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now wear and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only walden pond in the world and distiller of celestial dews.\n",
      "who knows in how many unremembered nations literatures this has been the castalian fountain.\n",
      "or what nymphs presided over it in the golden age.\n",
      "it is a gem of the first water which concord wears in her coronet.\n",
      "yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their footsteps.\n",
      "i have been surprised to detect encircling the pond even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore a narrow shelf-like path in the steep hill-side alternately rising and falling approaching and receding from the waters edge as old probably as the race of man here worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters and still from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land.\n",
      "this is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter just after a light snow has fallen appearing as a clear undulating white line unobscured by weeds and twigs and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable close at hand.\n",
      "the snow reprints it as it were in clear white type alto-relievo.\n",
      "the ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.\n",
      "the pond rises and falls but whether regularly or not and within what period nobody knows though as usual many pretend to know.\n",
      "it is commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer though not corresponding to the general wet and dryness.\n",
      "i can remember when it was a foot or two lower and also when it was at least five feet higher than when i lived by it.\n",
      "there is a narrow sand-bar running into it with very deep water on one side on which i helped boil a kettle of chowder some six rods from the main shore about the year 1824 which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years and on the other hand my friends used to listen with incredulity when i told them that a few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods fifteen rods from the only shore they knew which place was long since converted into a meadow.\n",
      "but the pond has risen steadily for two years and now in the summer of 52 is just five feet higher than when i lived there or as high as it was thirty years ago and fishing goes on again in the meadow.\n",
      "this makes a difference of level at the outside of six or seven feet and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs.\n",
      "this same summer the pond has begun to fall again.\n",
      "it is remarkable that this fluctuation whether periodical or not appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment.\n",
      "i have observed one rise and a part of two falls and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as i have ever known it.\n",
      "flints pond a mile eastward allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets and the smaller intermediate ponds also sympathize with walden and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter.\n",
      "the same is true as far as my observation goes of white pond.\n",
      "this rise and fall of walden at long intervals serves this use at least the water standing at this great height for a year or more though it makes it difficult to walk round it kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise pitch-pines birches alders aspens and others and falling again leaves an unobstructed shore for unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest.\n",
      "on the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever and thus a stop put to their encroachments and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height.\n",
      "by this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore and thus the shore is shorn and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession.\n",
      "these are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows.\n",
      "it licks its chaps from time to time.\n",
      "when the water is at its height the alders willows and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water and to the height of three or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintain themselves and i have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shore which commonly produce no fruit bear an abundant crop under these circumstances.\n",
      "some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved.\n",
      "my townsmen have all heard the tradition the oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youth that anciently the indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth and they used much profanity as the story goes though this vice is one of which the indians were never guilty and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank and only one old squaw named walden escaped and from her the pond was named.\n",
      "it has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore.\n",
      "it is very certain at any rate that once there was no pond here and now there is one and this indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i have mentioned who remembers so well when he first came here with his divining rod saw a thin vapor rising from the sward and the hazel pointed steadily downward and he concluded to dig a well here.\n",
      "as for the stones many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills but i observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond and moreover there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt so that unfortunately it is no longer a mystery to me.\n",
      "i detect the paver.\n",
      "if the name was not derived from that of some english locality—saffron walden for instance—one might suppose that it was called originally walled-in pond.\n",
      "the pond was my well ready dug.\n",
      "for four months in the year its water is as cold as it is pure at all times and i think that it is then as good as any if not the best in the town.\n",
      "in the winter all water which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are protected from it.\n",
      "the temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room where i sat from five oclock in the afternoon till noon the next day the sixth of march 1846 the thermometer having been up to 65° or 70° some of the time owing partly to the sun on the roof was 42° or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn.\n",
      "the temperature of the boiling spring the same day was 45° or the warmest of any water tried though it is the coldest that i know of in summer when beside shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it.\n",
      "moreover in summer walden never becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun on account of its depth.\n",
      "in the warmest weather i usually placed a pailful in my cellar where it became cool in the night and remained so during the day though i also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood.\n",
      "it was as good when a week old as the day it was dipped and had no taste of the pump.\n",
      "whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond needs only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the luxury of ice.\n",
      "there have been caught in walden pickerel one weighing seven pounds to say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity which the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not see him perch and pouts some of each weighing over two pounds shiners chivins or roach leuciscus pulchellus a very few breams and a couple of eels one weighing four pounds—i am thus particular because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame and these are the only eels i have heard of here—also i have a faint recollection of a little fish some five inches long with silvery sides and a greenish back somewhat dace-like in its character which i mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable.\n",
      "nevertheless this pond is not very fertile in fish.\n",
      "its pickerel though not abundant are its chief boast.\n",
      "i have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds a long and shallow one steel-colored most like those caught in the river a bright golden kind with greenish reflections and remarkably deep which is the most common here and another golden-colored and shaped like the last but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones very much like a trout.\n",
      "the specific name reticulatus would not apply to this it should be guttatus rather.\n",
      "these are all very firm fish and weigh more than their size promises.\n",
      "the shiners pouts and perch also and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond are much cleaner handsomer and firmer fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds as the water is purer and they can easily be distinguished from them.\n",
      "probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them.\n",
      "there are also a clean race of frogs and tortoises and a few muscels in it muskrats and minks leave their traces about it and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it.\n",
      "sometimes when i pushed off my boat in the morning i disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the night.\n",
      "ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall the white-bellied swallows hirundo bicolor skim over it and the peetweets totanus macularius teter along its stony shores all summer.\n",
      "i have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a white-pine over the water but i doubt if it is ever profaned by the wing of a gull like fair haven.\n",
      "at most it tolerates one annual loon.\n",
      "these are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now.\n",
      "you may see from a boat in calm weather near the sandy eastern shore where the water is eight or ten feet deep and also in some other parts of the pond some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height consisting of small stones less than a hens egg in size where all around is bare sand.\n",
      "at first you wonder if the indians could have formed them on the ice for any purpose and so when the ice melted they sank to the bottom but they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that.\n",
      "they are similar to those found in rivers but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here i know not by what fish they could be made.\n",
      "perhaps they are the nests of the chivin.\n",
      "these lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.\n",
      "the shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous.\n",
      "i have in my minds eye the western indented with deep bays the bolder northern and the beautifully scalloped southern shore where successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves between.\n",
      "the forest has never so good a setting nor is so distinctly beautiful as when seen from the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the waters edge for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best foreground in such a case but with its winding shore the most natural and agreeable boundary to it.\n",
      "there is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there as where the axe has cleared a part or a cultivated field abuts on it.\n",
      "the trees have ample room to expand on the water side and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that direction.\n",
      "there nature has woven a natural selvage and the eye rises by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest trees.\n",
      "there are few traces of mans hand to be seen.\n",
      "the water laves the shore as it did a thousand years ago.\n",
      "a lake is the landscapes most beautiful and expressive feature.\n",
      "it is earths eye looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature.\n",
      "the fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows.\n",
      "standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond in a calm september afternoon when a slight haze makes the opposite shore line indistinct i have seen whence came the expression the glassy surface of a lake.\n",
      " when you invert your head it looks like a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley and gleaming against the distant pine woods separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another.\n",
      "you would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills and that the swallows which skim over might perch on it.\n",
      "indeed they sometimes dive below this line as it were by mistake and are undeceived.\n",
      "as you look over the pond westward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well as the true sun for they are equally bright and if between the two you survey its surface critically it is literally as smooth as glass except where the skater insects at equal intervals scattered over its whole extent by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it or perchance a duck plumes itself or as i have said a swallow skims so low as to touch it.\n",
      "it may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air and there is one bright flash where it emerges and another where it strikes the water sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed or here and there perhaps is a thistle-down floating on its surface which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again.\n",
      "it is like molten glass cooled but not congealed and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in glass.\n",
      "you may often detect a yet smoother and darker water separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb boom of the water nymphs resting on it.\n",
      "from a hill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any part for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake.\n",
      "it is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is advertised—this piscine murder will out—and from my distant perch i distinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods in diameter.\n",
      "you can even detect a water-bug gyrinus ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a quarter of a mile off for they furrow the water slightly making a conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines but the skaters glide over it without rippling it perceptibly.\n",
      "when the surface is considerably agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it but apparently in calm days they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it.\n",
      "it is a soothing employment on one of those fine days in the fall when all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated to sit on a stump on such a height as this overlooking the pond and study the dimpling circles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected skies and trees.\n",
      "over this great expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and assuaged as when a vase of water is jarred the trembling circles seek the shore and all is smooth again.\n",
      "not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples in lines of beauty as it were the constant welling up of its fountain the gentle pulsing of its life the heaving of its breast.\n",
      "the thrills of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable.\n",
      "how peaceful the phenomena of the lake again the works of man shine as in the spring.\n",
      "ay every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now at mid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning.\n",
      "every motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light and if an oar falls how sweet the echo in such a day in september or october walden is a perfect forest mirror set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or rarer.\n",
      "nothing so fair so pure and at the same time so large as a lake perchance lies on the surface of the earth.\n",
      "sky water.\n",
      "it needs no fence.\n",
      "nations come and go without defiling it.\n",
      "it is a mirror which no stone can crack whose quicksilver will never wear off whose gilding nature continually repairs no storms no dust can dim its surface ever fresh—a mirror in which all impurity presented to it sinks swept and dusted by the suns hazy brush—this the light dust-cloth—which retains no breath that is breathed on it but sends its own to float as clouds high above its surface and be reflected in its bosom still.\n",
      "a field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air.\n",
      "it is continually receiving new life and motion from above.\n",
      "it is intermediate in its nature between land and sky.\n",
      "on land only the grass and trees wave but the water itself is rippled by the wind.\n",
      "i see where the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light.\n",
      "it is remarkable that we can look down on its surface.\n",
      "we shall perhaps look down thus on the surface of air at length and mark where a still subtler spirit sweeps over it.\n",
      "the skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of october when the severe frosts have come and then and in november usually in a calm day there is absolutely nothing to ripple the surface.\n",
      "one november afternoon in the calm at the end of a rain storm of several days duration when the sky was still completely overcast and the air was full of mist i observed that the pond was remarkably smooth so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface though it no longer reflected the bright tints of october but the sombre november colors of the surrounding hills.\n",
      "though i passed over it as gently as possible the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost as far as i could see and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections.\n",
      "but as i was looking over the surface i saw here and there at a distance a faint glimmer as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be collected there or perchance the surface being so smooth betrayed where a spring welled up from the bottom.\n",
      "paddling gently to one of these places i was surprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch about five inches long of a rich bronze color in the green water sporting there and constantly rising to the surface and dimpling it sometimes leaving bubbles on it.\n",
      "in such transparent and seemingly bottomless water reflecting the clouds i seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon and their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering as if they were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left their fins like sails set all around them.\n",
      "there were many such schools in the pond apparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze struck it or a few rain-drops fell there.\n",
      "when i approached carelessly and alarmed them they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough and instantly took refuge in the depths.\n",
      "at length the wind rose the mist increased and the waves began to run and the perch leaped much higher than before half out of water a hundred black points three inches long at once above the surface.\n",
      "even as late as the fifth of december one year i saw some dimples on the surface and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately the air being full of mist i made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward already the rain seemed rapidly increasing though i felt none on my cheek and i anticipated a thorough soaking.\n",
      "but suddenly the dimples ceased for they were produced by the perch which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths and i saw their schools dimly disappearing so i spent a dry afternoon after all.\n",
      "an old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago when it was dark with surrounding forests tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water fowl and that there were many eagles about it.\n",
      "he came here a-fishing and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore.\n",
      "it was made of two white-pine logs dug out and pinned together and was cut off square at the ends.\n",
      "it was very clumsy but lasted a great many years before it became water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom.\n",
      "he did not know whose it was it belonged to the pond.\n",
      "he used to make a cable for his anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together.\n",
      "an old man a potter who lived by the pond before the revolution told him once that there was an iron chest at the bottom and that he had seen it.\n",
      "sometimes it would come floating up to the shore but when you went toward it it would go back into deep water and disappear.\n",
      "i was pleased to hear of the old log canoe which took the place of an indian one of the same material but more graceful construction which perchance had first been a tree on the bank and then as it were fell into the water to float there for a generation the most proper vessel for the lake.\n",
      "i remember that when i first looked into these depths there were many large trunks to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom which had either been blown over formerly or left on the ice at the last cutting when wood was cheaper but now they have mostly disappeared.\n",
      "when i first paddled a boat on walden it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty pine and oak woods and in some of its coves grape vines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under which a boat could pass.\n",
      "the hills which form its shores are so steep and the woods on them were then so high that as you looked down from the west end it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind of sylvan spectacle.\n",
      "i have spent many an hour when i was younger floating over its surface as the zephyr willed having paddled my boat to the middle and lying on my back across the seats in a summer forenoon dreaming awake until i was aroused by the boat touching the sand and i arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to days when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry.\n",
      "many a forenoon have i stolen away preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day for i was rich if not in money in sunny hours and summer days and spent them lavishly nor do i regret that i did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teachers desk.\n",
      "but since i left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood with occasional vistas through which you see the water.\n",
      "my muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth.\n",
      "how can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down.\n",
      "now the trunks of trees on the bottom and the old log canoe and the dark surrounding woods are gone and the villagers who scarcely know where it lies instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink are thinking to bring its water which should be as sacred as the ganges at least to the village in a pipe to wash their dishes with—to earn their walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug that devilish iron horse whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town has muddied the boiling spring with his foot and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on walden shore that trojan horse with a thousand men in his belly introduced by mercenary greeks where is the countrys champion the moore of moore hill to meet him at the deep cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated pest.\n",
      "nevertheless of all the characters i have known perhaps walden wears best and best preserves its purity.\n",
      "many men have been likened to it but few deserve that honor.\n",
      "though the woodchoppers have laid bare first this shore and then that and the irish have built their sties by it and the railroad has infringed on its border and the ice-men have skimmed it once it is itself unchanged the same water which my youthful eyes fell on all the change is in me.\n",
      "it has not acquired one permanent wrinkle after all its ripples.\n",
      "it is perennially young and i may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its surface as of yore.\n",
      "it struck me again tonight as if i had not seen it almost daily for more than twenty years—why here is walden the same woodland lake that i discovered so many years ago where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then it is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its maker ay and it may be to me.\n",
      "it is the work of a brave man surely in whom there was no guile he rounded this water with his hand deepened and clarified it in his thought and in his will bequeathed it to concord.\n",
      "i see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection and i can almost say walden is it you.\n",
      "     it is no dream of mine      to ornament a line      i cannot come nearer to god and heaven      than i live to walden even.\n",
      "     i am its stony shore      and the breeze that passes oer      in the hollow of my hand      are its water and its sand      and its deepest resort      lies high in my thought.\n",
      "the cars never pause to look at it yet i fancy that the engineers and firemen and brakemen and those passengers who have a season ticket and see it often are better men for the sight.\n",
      "the engineer does not forget at night or his nature does not that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at least during the day.\n",
      "though seen but once it helps to wash out state-street and the engines soot.\n",
      "one proposes that it be called gods drop.\n",
      " i have said that walden has no visible inlet nor outlet but it is on the one hand distantly and indirectly related to flints pond which is more elevated by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter and on the other directly and manifestly to concord river which is lower by a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological period it may have flowed and by a little digging which god forbid it can be made to flow thither again.\n",
      "if by living thus reserved and austere like a hermit in the woods so long it has acquired such wonderful purity who would not regret that the comparatively impure waters of flints pond should be mingled with it or itself should ever go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave.\n",
      " flints or sandy pond in lincoln our greatest lake and inland sea lies about a mile east of walden.\n",
      "it is much larger being said to contain one hundred and ninety-seven acres and is more fertile in fish but it is comparatively shallow and not remarkably pure.\n",
      "a walk through the woods thither was often my recreation.\n",
      "it was worth the while if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely and see the waves run and remember the life of mariners.\n",
      "i went a-chestnutting there in the fall on windy days when the nuts were dropping into the water and were washed to my feet and one day as i crept along its sedgy shore the fresh spray blowing in my face i came upon the mouldering wreck of a boat the sides gone and hardly more than the impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes yet its model was sharply defined as if it were a large decayed pad with its veins.\n",
      "it was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore and had as good a moral.\n",
      "it is by this time mere vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond shore through which rushes and flags have pushed up.\n",
      "i used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom at the north end of this pond made firm and hard to the feet of the wader by the pressure of the water and the rushes which grew in indian file in waving lines corresponding to these marks rank behind rank as if the waves had planted them.\n",
      "there also i have found in considerable quantities curious balls composed apparently of fine grass or roots of pipewort perhaps from half an inch to four inches in diameter and perfectly spherical.\n",
      "these wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy bottom and are sometimes cast on the shore.\n",
      "they are either solid grass or have a little sand in the middle.\n",
      "at first you would say that they were formed by the action of the waves like a pebble yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials half an inch long and they are produced only at one season of the year.\n",
      "moreover the waves i suspect do not so much construct as wear down a material which has already acquired consistency.\n",
      "they preserve their form when dry for an indefinite period.\n",

      "i go not there to see him nor to hear of him who never saw it who never bathed in it who never loved it who never protected it who never spoke a good word for it nor thanked god that he had made it.\n",
      "rather let it be named from the fishes that swim in it the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it the wild flowers which grow by its shores or some wild man or child the thread of whose history is interwoven with its own not from him who could show no title to it but the deed which a like-minded neighbor or legislature gave him—him who thought only of its money value whose presence perchance cursed all the shore who exhausted the land around it and would fain have exhausted the waters within it who regretted only that it was not english hay or cranberry meadow—there was nothing to redeem it forsooth in his eyes—and would have drained and sold it for the mud at its bottom.\n",
      "it did not turn his mill and it was no privilege to him to behold it.\n",
      "i respect not his labors his farm where every thing has its price who would carry the landscape who would carry his god to market if he could get any thing for him who goes to market for his god as it is on whose farm nothing grows free whose fields bear no crops whose meadows no flowers whose trees no fruits but dollars who loves not the beauty of his fruits whose fruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars.\n",

      "since the woodcutters and the railroad and i myself have profaned walden perhaps the most attractive if not the most beautiful of all our lakes the gem of the woods is white pond—a poor name from its commonness whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands.\n",
      "in these as in other respects however it is a lesser twin of walden.\n",
      "they are so much alike that you would say they must be connected under ground.\n",
      "it has the same stony shore and its waters are of the same hue.\n",
      "as at walden in sultry dog-day weather looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them its waters are of a misty bluish-green or glaucous color.\n",

      "one who frequents it proposes to call it virid lake.\n",
      "perhaps it might be called yellow-pine lake from the following circumstance.\n",
      "about fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch-pine of the kind called yellow-pine hereabouts though it is not a distinct species projecting above the surface in deep water many rods from the shore.\n",
      "it was even supposed by some that the pond had sunk and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood there.\n",
      "i find that even so long ago as 1792 in a topographical description of the town of concord by one of its citizens in the collections of the massachusetts historical society the author after speaking of walden and white ponds adds in the middle of the latter may be seen when the water is very low a tree which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands although the roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water the top of this tree is broken off and at that place measures fourteen inches in diameter.\n",
      " in the spring of 49 i talked with the man who lives nearest the pond in sudbury who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or fifteen years before.\n",
      "as near as he could remember it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore where the water was thirty or forty feet deep.\n",
      "it was in the winter and he had been getting out ice in the forenoon and had resolved that in the afternoon with the aid of his neighbors he would take out the old yellow-pine.\n",
      "he sawed a channel in the ice toward the shore and hauled it over and along and out on to the ice with oxen but before he had gone far in his work he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward with the stumps of the branches pointing down and the small end firmly fastened in the sandy bottom.\n",
      "it was about a foot in diameter at the big end and he had expected to get a good saw-log but it was so rotten as to be fit only for fuel if for that.\n",
      "he had some of it in his shed then.\n",
      "there were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt.\n",
      "he thought that it might have been a dead tree on the shore but was finally blown over into the pond and after the top had become waterlogged while the butt-end was still dry and light had drifted out and sunk wrong end up.\n",
      "his father eighty years old could not remember when it was not there.\n",
      "several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottom where owing to the undulation of the surface they look like huge water snakes in motion.\n",
      "this pond has rarely been profaned by a boat for there is little in it to tempt a fisherman.\n",
      "instead of the white lily which requires mud or the common sweet flag the blue flag iris versicolor grows thinly in the pure water rising from the stony bottom all around the shore where it is visited by humming birds in june and the color both of its bluish blades and its flowers and especially their reflections are in singular harmony with the glaucous water.\n",
      "white pond and walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth lakes of light.\n",
      "if they were permanently congealed and small enough to be clutched they would perchance be carried off by slaves like precious stones to adorn the heads of emperors but being liquid and ample and secured to us and our successors forever we disregard them and run after the diamond of kohinoor.\n",

      " baker farm sometimes i rambled to pine groves standing like temples or like fleets at sea full-rigged with wavy boughs and rippling with light so soft and green and shady that the druids would have forsaken their oaks to worship in them or to the cedar wood beyond flints pond where the trees covered with hoary blue berries spiring higher and higher are fit to stand before valhalla and the creeping juniper covers the ground with wreaths full of fruit or to swamps where the usnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white-spruce trees and toad-stools round tables of the swamp gods cover the ground and more beautiful fungi adorn the stumps like butterflies or shells vegetable winkles where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow the red alder-berry glows like eyes of imps the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest woods in its folds and the wild-holly berries make the beholder forget his home with their beauty and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless other wild forbidden fruits too fair for mortal taste.\n",
      "instead of calling on some scholar i paid many a visit to particular trees of kinds which are rare in this neighborhood standing far away in the middle of some pasture or in the depths of a wood or swamp or on a hill-top such as the black-birch of which we have some handsome specimens two feet in diameter its cousin the yellow birch with its loose golden vest perfumed like the first the beech which has so neat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted perfect in all its details of which excepting scattered specimens i know but one small grove of sizable trees left in the township supposed by some to have been planted by the pigeons that were once baited with beech nuts near by it is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you split this wood the bass the hornbeam the celtis occidentalis or false elm of which we have but one well-grown some taller mast of a pine a shingle tree or a more perfect hemlock than usual standing like a pagoda in the midst of the woods and many others i could mention.\n",

      "if it had lasted longer it might have tinged my employments and life.\n",

      " i set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to fair-haven through the woods to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables.\n",
      "my way led through pleasant meadow an adjunct of the baker farm that retreat of which a poet has since sung beginning—      thy entry is a pleasant field      which some mossy fruit trees yield      partly to a ruddy brook      by gliding musquash undertook      and mercurial trout      darting about.\n",
      " i thought of living there before i went to walden.\n",
      "i hooked the apples leaped the brook and scared the musquash and the trout.\n",
      "it was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one in which many events may happen a large portion of our natural life though it was already half spent when i started.\n",
      "by the way there came up a shower which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine piling boughs over my head and wearing my handkerchief for a shed and when at length i had made one cast over the pickerel-weed standing up to my middle in water i found myself suddenly in the shadow of a cloud and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that i could do no more than listen to it.\n",
      "the gods must be proud thought i with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman.\n",
      "so i made haste for shelter to the nearest hut which stood half a mile from any road but so much the nearer to the pond and had long been uninhabited—      and here a poet builded          in the completed years      for behold a trivial cabin          that to destruction steers.\n",
      " so the muse fables.\n",
      "but therein as i found dwelt now john field an irishman and his wife and several children from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the rain to the wrinkled sibyl-like cone-headed infant that sat upon its fathers knee as in the palaces of nobles and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger with the privilege of infancy not knowing but it was the last of a noble line and the hope and cynosure of the world instead of john fields poor starveling brat.\n",
      "there we sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least while it showered and thundered without.\n",
      "i had sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to america.\n",
      "an honest hard-working but shiftless man plainly was john field and his wife she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove with round greasy face and bare breast still thinking to improve her condition one day with the never absent mop in one hand and yet no effects of it visible anywhere.\n",
      "the chickens which had also taken shelter here from the rain stalked about the room like members of the family too humanized methought to roast well.\n",
      "they stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe significantly.\n",
      "meanwhile my host told me his story how hard he worked bogging for a neighboring farmer turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with manure for one year and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his fathers side the while not knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made.\n",
      "i tried to help him with my experience telling him that he was one of my nearest neighbors and that i too who came a-fishing here and looked like a loafer was getting my living like himself that i lived in a tight light and clean house which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to and how if he chose he might in a month or two build himself a palace of his own that i did not use tea nor coffee nor butter nor milk nor fresh meat and so did not have to work to get them again as i did not work hard i did not have to eat hard and it cost me but a trifle for my food but as he began with tea and coffee and butter and milk and beef he had to work hard to pay for them and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his system—and so it was as broad as it was long indeed it was broader than it was long for he was discontented and wasted his life into the bargain and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to america that here you could get tea and coffee and meat every day.\n",
      "but the only true america is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these and where the state does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of such things.\n",
      "for i purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher or desired to be one.\n",

      "a man will not need to study history to find out what is best for his own culture.\n",
      "but alas the culture of an irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of moral bog hoe.\n",
      "i told him that as he worked so hard at bogging he required thick boots and stout clothing which yet were soon soiled and worn out but i wore light shoes and thin clothing which cost not half so much though he might think that i was dressed like a gentleman which however was not the case and in an hour or two without labor but as a recreation i could if i wished catch as many fish as i should want for two days or earn enough money to support me a week.\n",
      "if he and his family would live simply they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement.\n",
      "john heaved a sigh at this and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with or arithmetic enough to carry it through.\n",
      "it was sailing by dead reckoning to them and they saw not clearly how to make their port so therefore i suppose they still take life bravely after their fashion face to face giving it tooth and nail not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge and rout it in detail—thinking to deal with it roughly as one should handle a thistle.\n",
      "but they fight at an overwhelming disadvantage—living john field alas without arithmetic and failing so.\n",
      "do you ever fish.\n",
      " i asked.\n",
      "oh yes i catch a mess now and then when i am lying by good perch i catch.\n",

      "as i was leaving the irishmans roof after the rain bending my steps again to the pond my haste to catch pickerel wading in retired meadows in sloughs and bog-holes in forlorn and savage places appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and college but as i ran down the hill toward the reddening west with the rainbow over my shoulder and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear through the cleansed air from i know not what quarter my good genius seemed to say—go fish and hunt far and wide day by day—farther and wider—and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without misgiving.\n",

      "before i had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out john field with altered mind letting go bogging ere this sunset.\n",

      "once or twice however while i lived at the pond i found myself ranging the woods like a half-starved hound with a strange abandonment seeking some kind of venison which i might devour and no morsel could have been too savage for me.\n",
      "the wildest scenes had become unaccountably familiar.\n",

      "i have actually fished from the same kind of necessity that the first fishers did.\n",
      "whatever humanity i might conjure up against it was all factitious and concerned my philosophy more than my feelings.\n",

      "but i confess that i am now inclined to think that there is a finer way of studying ornithology than this.\n",
      "it requires so much closer attention to the habits of the birds that if for that reason only i have been willing to omit the gun.\n",
      "yet notwithstanding the objection on the score of humanity i am compelled to doubt if equally valuable sports are ever substituted for these and when some of my friends have asked me anxiously about their boys whether they should let them hunt i have answered yes—remembering that it was one of the best parts of my education—make them hunters though sportsmen only at first if possible mighty hunters at last so that they shall not find game large enough for them in this or any vegetable wilderness—hunters as well as fishers of men.\n",

      "commonly they did not think that they were lucky or well paid for their time unless they got a long string of fish though they had the opportunity of seeing the pond all the while.\n",
      "they might go there a thousand times before the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave their purpose pure but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on all the while.\n",

      "i have skill at it and like many of my fellows a certain instinct for it which revives from time to time but always when i have done i feel that it would have been better if i had not fished.\n",
      "i think that i do not mistake.\n",
      "it is a faint intimation yet so are the first streaks of morning.\n",
      "there is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to the lower orders of creation yet with every year i am less a fisherman though without more humanity or even wisdom at present i am no fisherman at all.\n",
      "but i see that if i were to live in a wilderness i should again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest.\n",
      "beside there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all flesh and i began to see where housework commences and whence the endeavor which costs so much to wear a tidy and respectable appearance each day to keep the house sweet and free from all ill odors and sights.\n",
      "having been my own butcher and scullion and cook as well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up i can speak from an unusually complete experience.\n",
      "the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially.\n",
      "it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to.\n",
      "a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth.\n",
      "like many of my contemporaries i had rarely for many years used animal food or tea or coffee &c.\n",
      "not so much because of any ill effects which i had traced to them as because they were not agreeable to my imagination.\n",
      "the repugnance to animal food is not the effect of experience but is an instinct.\n",
      "it appeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects and though i never did so i went far enough to please my imagination.\n",
      "i believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food and from much food of any kind.\n",
      "it is a significant fact stated by entomologists i find it in kirby and spence that some insects in their perfect state though furnished with organs of feeding make no use of them and they lay it down as a general rule that almost all insects in this state eat much less than in that of larvæ.\n",
      "the voracious caterpillar when transformed into a butterfly .\n",
      ".\n",
      "and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet liquid.\n",

      "this is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate.\n",
      "the gross feeder is a man in the larva state and there are whole nations in that condition nations without fancy or imagination whose vast abdomens betray them.\n",
      "it is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend the imagination but this i think is to be fed when we feed the body they should both sit down at the same table.\n",
      "yet perhaps this may be done.\n",
      "the fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of our appetites nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits.\n",

      "most men would feel shame if caught preparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner whether of animal or vegetable food as is every day prepared for them by others.\n",

      "i am satisfied that it is not.\n",
      "is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal.\n",
      "true he can and does live in a great measure by preying on other animals but this is a miserable way—as any one who will go to snaring rabbits or slaughtering lambs may learn—and he will be regarded as a benefactor of his race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocent and wholesome diet.\n",
      "whatever my own practice may be i have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race in its gradual improvement to leave off eating animals as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized.\n",
      "if one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius which are certainly true he sees not to what extremes or even insanity it may lead him and yet that way as he grows more resolute and faithful his road lies.\n",

      "on every side they were engaged in deadly combat yet without any noise that i could hear and human soldiers never fought so resolutely.\n",
      "i watched a couple that were fast locked in each others embraces in a little sunny valley amid the chips now at noon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down or life went out.\n",
      "the smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversarys front and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root having already caused the other to go by the board while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side and as i saw on looking nearer had already divested him of several of his members.\n",
      "they fought with more pertinacity than bull-dogs.\n",
      "neither manifested the least disposition to retreat.\n",
      "it was evident that their battle-cry was conquer or die.\n",
      "in the mean while there came along a single red ant on the hill-side of this valley evidently full of excitement who either had despatched his foe or had not yet taken part in the battle probably the latter for he had lost none of his limbs whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it.\n",
      "or perchance he was some achilles who had nourished his wrath apart and had now come to avenge or rescue his patroclus.\n",
      "he saw this unequal combat from afar—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red—he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants then watching his opportunity he sprang upon the black warrior and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore-leg leaving the foe to select among his own members and so there were three united for life as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame.\n",
      "i should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip and playing their national airs the while to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants.\n",
      "i was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men.\n",
      "the more you think of it the less the difference.\n",
      "and certainly there is not the fight recorded in concord history at least if in the history of america that will bear a moments comparison with this whether for the numbers engaged in it or for the patriotism and heroism displayed.\n",
      "for numbers and for carnage it was an austerlitz or dresden.\n",
      "concord fight two killed on the patriots side and luther blanchard wounded why here every ant was a buttrick—fire for gods sake fire—and thousands shared the fate of davis and hosmer.\n",
      "there was not one hireling there.\n",
      "i have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for as much as our ancestors and not to avoid a three-penny tax on their tea and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the battle of bunker hill at least.\n",
      "i took up the chip on which the three i have particularly described were struggling carried it into my house and placed it under a tumbler on my window-sill in order to see the issue.\n",
      "holding a microscope to the first-mentioned red ant i saw that though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy having severed his remaining feeler his own breast was all torn away exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce and the dark carbuncles of the sufferers eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite.\n",
      "they struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler and when i looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow still apparently as firmly fastened as ever and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg and i know not how many other wounds to divest himself of them which at length after half an hour more he accomplished.\n",
      "i raised the glass and he went off over the window-sill in that crippled state.\n",
      "whether he finally survived that combat and spent the remainder of his days in some hotel des invalides i do not know but i thought that his industry would not be worth much thereafter.\n",
      "i never learned which party was victorious nor the cause of the war but i felt for the rest of that day as if i had had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle the ferocity and carnage of a human battle before my door.\n",
      "kirby and spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been celebrated and the date of them recorded though they say that huber is the only modern author who appears to have witnessed them.\n",
      "æneas sylvius say they after giving a very circumstantial account of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the trunk of a pear tree adds that ‘this action was fought in the pontificate of eugenius the fourth in the presence of nicholas pistoriensis an eminent lawyer who related the whole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity.\n",
      " a similar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by olaus magnus in which the small ones being victorious are said to have buried the bodies of their own soldiers but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds.\n",
      "this event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant christiern the second from sweden.\n",
      " the battle which i witnessed took place in the presidency of polk five years before the passage of websters fugitive-slave bill.\n",
      "many a village bose fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling cellar sported his heavy quarters in the woods without the knowledge of his master and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and woodchucks holes led perchance by some slight cur which nimbly threaded the wood and might still inspire a natural terror in its denizens—now far behind his guide barking like a canine bull toward some small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny then cantering off bending the bushes with his weight imagining that he is on the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family.\n",
      "once i was surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond for they rarely wander so far from home.\n",
      "the surprise was mutual.\n",
      "nevertheless the most domestic cat which has lain on a rug all her days appears quite at home in the woods and by her sly and stealthy behavior proves herself more native there than the regular inhabitants.\n",
      "once when berrying i met with a cat with young kittens in the woods quite wild and they all like their mother had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me.\n",
      "a few years before i lived in the woods there was what was called a winged cat in one of the farm-houses in lincoln nearest the pond mr.\n",
      "gilian bakers.\n",
      "when i called to see her in june 1842 she was gone a-hunting in the woods as was her wont i am not sure whether it was a male or female and so use the more common pronoun but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood a little more than a year before in april and was finally taken into their house that she was of a dark brownish-gray color with a white spot on her throat and white feet and had a large bushy tail like a fox that in the winter the fur grew thick and flatted out along her sides forming stripes ten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide and under her chin like a muff the upper side loose the under matted like felt and in the spring these appendages dropped off.\n",
      "they gave me a pair of her wings which i keep still.\n",
      "there is no appearance of a membrane about them.\n",
      "some thought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal which is not impossible for according to naturalists prolific hybrids have been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat.\n",
      "this would have been the right kind of cat for me to keep if i had kept any for why should not a poets cat be winged as well as his horse.\n",
      "in the fall the loon colymbus glacialis came as usual to moult and bathe in the pond making the woods ring with his wild laughter before i had risen.\n",
      "at rumor of his arrival all the mill-dam sportsmen are on the alert in gigs and on foot two by two and three by three with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses.\n",
      "they come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves at least ten men to one loon.\n",
      "some station themselves on this side of the pond some on that for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent if he dive here he must come up there.\n",
      "but now the kind october wind rises rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water so that no loon can be heard or seen though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses and make the woods resound with their discharges.\n",
      "the waves generously rise and dash angrily taking sides with all water-fowl and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs.\n",
      "but they were too often successful.\n",
      "when i went to get a pail of water early in the morning i frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods.\n",
      "if i endeavored to overtake him in a boat in order to see how he would manœuvre he would dive and be completely lost so that i did not discover him again sometimes till the latter part of the day.\n",
      "but i was more than a match for him on the surface.\n",
      "he commonly went off in a rain.\n",
      "as i was paddling along the north shore one very calm october afternoon for such days especially they settle on to the lakes like the milkweed down having looked in vain over the pond for a loon suddenly one sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself.\n",
      "i pursued with a paddle and he dived but when he came up i was nearer than before.\n",
      "he dived again but i miscalculated the direction he would take and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time for i had helped to widen the interval and again he laughed long and loud and with more reason than before.\n",
      "he manœuvred so cunningly that i could not get within half a dozen rods of him.\n",
      "each time when he came to the surface turning his head this way and that he cooly surveyed the water and the land and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat.\n",
      "it was surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution.\n",
      "he led me at once to the widest part of the pond and could not be driven from it.\n",
      "while he was thinking one thing in his brain i was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine.\n",
      "it was a pretty game played on the smooth surface of the pond a man against a loon.\n",
      "suddenly your adversarys checker disappears beneath the board and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again.\n",
      "sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me having apparently passed directly under the boat.\n",
      "so long-winded was he and so unweariable that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again nevertheless and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond beneath the smooth surface he might be speeding his way like a fish for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part.\n",
      "it is said that loons have been caught in the new york lakes eighty feet beneath the surface with hooks set for trout—though walden is deeper than that.\n",
      "how surprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their schools yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface and swam much faster there.\n",
      "once or twice i saw a ripple where he approached the surface just put his head out to reconnoitre and instantly dived again.\n",
      "i found that it was as well for me to rest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would rise for again and again when i was straining my eyes over the surface one way i would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me.\n",
      "but why after displaying so much cunning did he invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh.\n",
      "did not his white breast enough betray him.\n",
      "he was indeed a silly loon i thought.\n",
      "i could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up and so also detected him.\n",
      "but after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first.\n",
      "it was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath.\n",
      "his usual note was this demoniac laughter yet somewhat like that of a water-fowl but occasionally when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl probably more like that of a wolf than any bird as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls.\n",
      "this was his looning—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here making the woods ring far and wide.\n",
      "i concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts confident of his own resources.\n",
      "though the sky was by this time overcast the pond was so smooth that i could see where he broke the surface when i did not hear him.\n",
      "his white breast the stillness of the air and the smoothness of the water were all against him.\n",
      "at length having come up fifty rods off he uttered one of those prolonged howls as if calling on the god of loons to aid him and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the surface and filled the whole air with misty rain and i was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered and his god was angry with me and so i left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface.\n",
      "for hours in fall days i watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the middle of the pond far from the sportsman tricks which they will have less need to practise in louisiana bayous.\n",
      "when compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river like black motes in the sky and when i thought they had gone off thither long since they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of walden i do not know unless they love its water for the same reason that i do.\n",
      " house-warming in october i went a-graping to the river meadows and loaded myself with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food.\n",
      "there too i admired though i did not gather the cranberries small waxen gems pendants of the meadow grass pearly and red which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only and sells the spoils of the meads to boston and new york destined to be jammed to satisfy the tastes of lovers of nature there.\n",
      "so butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass regardless of the torn and drooping plant.\n",
      "the barberrys brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely but i collected a small store of wild apples for coddling which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked.\n",
      "when chestnuts were ripe i laid up half a bushel for winter.\n",
      "it was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of lincoln—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad—with a bag on my shoulder and a stick to open burrs with in my hand for i did not always wait for the frost amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays whose half-consumed nuts i sometimes stole for the burrs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones.\n",
      "occasionally i climbed and shook the trees.\n",
      "they grew also behind my house and one large tree which almost overshadowed it was when in flower a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit the last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burrs before they fell.\n",
      "i relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut.\n",
      "these nuts as far as they went were a good substitute for bread.\n",
      "many other substitutes might perhaps be found.\n",
      "digging one day for fish-worms i discovered the ground-nut apios tuberosa on its string the potato of the aborigines a sort of fabulous fruit which i had begun to doubt if i had ever dug and eaten in childhood as i had told and had not dreamed it.\n",
      "i had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same.\n",
      "cultivation has well nigh exterminated it.\n",
      "it has a sweetish taste much like that of a frostbitten potato and i found it better boiled than roasted.\n",
      "this tuber seemed like a faint promise of nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period.\n",
      "in these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this humble root which was once the totem of an indian tribe is quite forgotten or known only by its flowering vine but let wild nature reign here once more and the tender and luxurious english grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes and without the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great cornfield of the indians god in the south-west whence he is said to have brought it but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness prove itself indigenous and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter tribe.\n",
      "some indian ceres or minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of it and when the reign of poetry commences here its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of art.\n",
      "already by the first of september i had seen two or three small maples turned scarlet across the pond beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged at the point of a promontory next the water.\n",
      "ah many a tale their color told and gradually from week to week the character of each tree came out and it admired itself reflected in the smooth mirror of the lake.\n",
      "each morning the manager of this gallery substituted some new picture distinguished by more brilliant or harmonious coloring for the old upon the walls.\n",
      "the wasps came by thousands to my lodge in october as to winter quarters and settled on my windows within and on the walls over-head sometimes deterring visitors from entering.\n",
      "each morning when they were numbed with cold i swept some of them out but i did not trouble myself much to get rid of them i even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable shelter.\n",
      "they never molested me seriously though they bedded with me and they gradually disappeared into what crevices i do not know avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.\n",
      "like the wasps before i finally went into winter quarters in november i used to resort to the north-east side of walden which the sun reflected from the pitch-pine woods and the stony shore made the fire-side of the pond it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be than by an artificial fire.\n",
      "i thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer like a departed hunter had left.\n",
      " when i came to build my chimney i studied masonry.\n",
      "my bricks being second-hand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel so that i learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels.\n",
      "the mortar on them was fifty years old and was said to be still growing harder but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat whether they are true or not.\n",
      "such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of them.\n",
      "many of the villages of mesopotamia are built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality obtained from the ruins of babylon and the cement on them is older and probably harder still.\n",
      "however that may be i was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out.\n",
      "as my bricks had been in a chimney before though i did not read the name of nebuchadnezzar on them i picked out as many fire-place bricks as i could find to save work and waste and i filled the spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the pond shore and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place.\n",
      "i lingered most about the fireplace as the most vital part of the house.\n",
      "indeed i worked so deliberately that though i commenced at the ground in the morning a course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night yet i did not get a stiff neck for it that i remember my stiff neck is of older date.\n",
      "i took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times which caused me to be put to it for room.\n",
      "he brought his own knife though i had two and we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth.\n",
      "he shared with me the labors of cooking.\n",
      "i was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid by degrees and reflected that if it proceeded slowly it was calculated to endure a long time.\n",
      "the chimney is to some extent an independent structure standing on the ground and rising through the house to the heavens even after the house is burned it still stands sometimes and its importance and independence are apparent.\n",
      "this was toward the end of summer.\n",
      "it was now november.\n",
      " the north wind had already begun to cool the pond though it took many weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it it is so deep.\n",
      "when i began to have a fire at evening before i plastered my house the chimney carried smoke particularly well because of the numerous chinks between the boards.\n",
      "yet i passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots and rafters with the bark on high overhead.\n",
      "my house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered though i was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable.\n",
      "should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity over-head where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters.\n",
      "these forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture.\n",
      "i now first began to inhabit my house i may say when i began to use it for warmth as well as shelter.\n",
      "i had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth and it did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which i had built and i poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual.\n",
      "my dwelling was small and i could hardly entertain an echo in it but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors.\n",
      "all the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room it was kitchen chamber parlor and keeping-room and whatever satisfaction parent or child master or servant derive from living in a house i enjoyed it all.\n",
      "cato says the master of a family patremfamilias must have in his rustic villa cellam oleariam vinariam dolia multa uti lubeat caritatem expectare et rei et virtuti et gloriæ erit that is an oil and wine cellar many casks so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times it will be for his advantage and virtue and glory.\n",
      " i had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them and on my shelf a little rice a jug of molasses and of rye and indian meal a peck each.\n",
      "i sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house standing in a golden age of enduring materials and without ginger-bread work which shall still consist of only one room a vast rude substantial primitive hall without ceiling or plastering with bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over ones head—useful to keep off rain and snow where the king and queen posts stand out to receive your homage when you have done reverence to the prostrate saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill a cavernous house wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof where some may live in the fire-place some in the recess of a window and some on settles some at one end of the hall some at another and some aloft on rafters with the spiders if they choose a house which you have got into when you have opened the outside door and the ceremony is over where the weary traveller may wash and eat and converse and sleep without further journey such a shelter as you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night containing all the essentials of a house and nothing for house-keeping where you can see all the treasures of the house at one view and every thing hangs upon its peg that a man should use at once kitchen pantry parlor chamber store-house and garret where you can see so necessary a thing as a barrel or a ladder so convenient a thing as a cupboard and hear the pot boil and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your dinner and the oven that bakes your bread and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments where the washing is not put out nor the fire nor the mistress and perhaps you are sometimes requested to move from off the trap-door when the cook would descend into the cellar and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you without stamping.\n",
      "a house whose inside is as open and manifest as a birds nest and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back without seeing some of its inhabitants where to be a guest is to be presented with the freedom of the house and not to be carefully excluded from seven eighths of it shut up in a particular cell and told to make yourself at home there—in solitary confinement.\n",
      "nowadays the host does not admit you to his hearth but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in his alley and hospitality is the art of keeping you at the greatest distance.\n",
      "there is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you.\n",
      "i am aware that i have been on many a mans premises and might have been legally ordered off but i am not aware that i have been in many mens houses.\n",
      "i might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in such a house as i have described if i were going their way but backing out of a modern palace will be all that i shall desire to learn if ever i am caught in one.\n",
      "it would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into palaver wholly our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched through slides and dumb-waiters as it were in other words the parlor is so far from the kitchen and workshop.\n",
      "the dinner even is only the parable of a dinner commonly.\n",
      "as if only the savage dwelt near enough to nature and truth to borrow a trope from them.\n",
      "how can the scholar who dwells away in the north west territory or the isle of man tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen.\n",
      "however only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a hasty-pudding with me but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a hasty retreat rather as if it would shake the house to its foundations.\n",
      "nevertheless it stood through a great many hasty-puddings.\n",
      "i did not plaster till it was freezing weather.\n",
      "i brought over some whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary.\n",
      "my house had in the mean while been shingled down to the ground on every side.\n",
      "in lathing i was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly.\n",
      "i remembered the story of a conceited fellow who in fine clothes was wont to lounge about the village once giving advice to workmen.\n",
      "venturing one day to substitute deeds for words he turned up his cuffs seized a plasterers board and having loaded his trowel without mishap with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead made a bold gesture thitherward and straightway to his complete discomfiture received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom.\n",
      "i admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish and i learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable.\n",
      "i was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before i had smoothed it and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth.\n",
      "i had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the unio fluviatilis which our river affords for the sake of the experiment so that i knew where my materials came from.\n",
      "i might have got good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself if i had cared to do so.\n",
      " the pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest coves some days or even weeks before the general freezing.\n",
      "the first ice is especially interesting and perfect being hard dark and transparent and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick like a skater insect on the surface of the water and study the bottom at your leisure only two or three inches distant like a picture behind a glass and the water is necessarily always smooth then.\n",
      "there are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks and for wrecks it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute grains of white quartz.\n",
      "perhaps these have creased it for you find some of their cases in the furrows though they are deep and broad for them to make.\n",
      "but the ice itself is the object of most interest though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it.\n",
      "if you examine it closely the morning after it freezes you find that the greater part of the bubbles which at first appeared to be within it are against its under surface and that more are continually rising from the bottom while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark that is you see the water through it.\n",
      "these bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter very clear and beautiful and you see your face reflected in them through the ice.\n",
      "there may be thirty or forty of them to a square inch.\n",
      "there are also already within the ice narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long sharp cones with the apex upward or oftener if the ice is quite fresh minute spherical bubbles one directly above another like a string of beads.\n",
      "but these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath.\n",
      "i sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice and those which broke through carried in air with them which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath.\n",
      "one day when i came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward i found that those large bubbles were still perfect though an inch more of ice had formed as i could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.\n",
      "but as the last two days had been very warm like an indian summer the ice was not now transparent showing the dark green color of the water and the bottom but opaque and whitish or gray and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together and lost their regularity they were no longer one directly over another but often like silvery coins poured from a bag one overlapping another or in thin flakes as if occupying slight cleavages.\n",
      "the beauty of the ice was gone and it was too late to study the bottom.\n",
      "being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice i broke out a cake containing a middling sized one and turned it bottom upward.\n",
      "the new ice had formed around and under the bubble so that it was included between the two ices.\n",
      "it was wholly in the lower ice but close against the upper and was flattish or perhaps slightly lenticular with a rounded edge a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter and i was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle leaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble hardly an eighth of an inch thick and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward and probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles which were a foot in diameter.\n",
      "i inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which i had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise and that each in its degree had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it.\n",
      "these are the little air-guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop.\n",
      " at length the winter set in in good earnest just as i had finished plastering and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then.\n",
      "night after night the geese came lumbering in in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings even after the ground was covered with snow some to alight in walden and some flying low over the woods toward fair haven bound for mexico.\n",
      "several times when returning from the village at ten or eleven oclock at night i heard the tread of a flock of geese or else ducks on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling where they had come up to feed and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off.\n",
      "in 1845 walden froze entirely over for the first time on the night of the 22d of december flints and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more in 46 the 16th in 49 about the 31st and in 50 about the 27th of december in 52 the 5th of january in 53 the 31st of december.\n",
      "the snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of november and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter.\n",
      "i withdrew yet farther into my shell and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast.\n",
      "my employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed.\n",
      "an old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me.\n",
      "i sacrificed it to vulcan for it was past serving the god terminus.\n",
      "how much more interesting an event is that mans supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt nay you might say steal the fuel to cook it with his bread and meat are sweet.\n",
      "there are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires but which at present warm none and some think hinder the growth of the young wood.\n",
      "there was also the drift-wood of the pond.\n",
      "in the course of the summer i had discovered a raft of pitch-pine logs with the bark on pinned together by the irish when the railroad was built.\n",
      "this i hauled up partly on the shore.\n",
      "after soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound though waterlogged past drying.\n",
      "i amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond nearly half a mile skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder and the other on the ice or i tied several logs together with a birch withe and then with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end dragged them across.\n",
      "though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead they not only burned long but made a very hot fire nay i thought that they burned better for the soaking as if the pitch being confined by the water burned longer as in a lamp.\n",
      "gilpin in his account of the forest borderers of england says that the encroachments of trespassers and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of the forest were considered as great nuisances by the old forest law and were severely punished under the name of purprestures as tending ad terrorem ferarum—ad nocumentum forestæ &c.\n",
      " to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the forest.\n",
      "but i was interested in the preservation of the venison and the vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers and as much as though i had been the lord warden himself and if any part was burned though i burned it myself by accident i grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors nay i grieved when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves.\n",
      "i would that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old romans did when they came to thin or let in the light to a consecrated grove lucum conlucare that is would believe that it is sacred to some god.\n",
      "the roman made an expiatory offering and prayed whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred be propitious to me my family and children &c.\n",
      "it is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in this new country a value more permanent and universal than that of gold.\n",
      "after all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood.\n",
      "it is as precious to us as it was to our saxon and norman ancestors.\n",
      "if they made their bows of it we make our gun-stocks of it.\n",
      "michaux more than thirty years ago says that the price of wood for fuel in new york and philadelphia nearly equals and sometimes exceeds that of the best wood in paris though this immense capital annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords and is surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated plains.\n",
      " in this town the price of wood rises almost steadily and the only question is how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last.\n",
      "mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand are sure to attend the wood auction and even pay a high price for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper.\n",
      "it is now many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the materials of the arts the new englander and the new hollander the parisian and the celt the farmer and robinhood goody blake and harry gill in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant the scholar and the savage equally require still a few sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food.\n",
      "neither could i do without them.\n",
      "every man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection.\n",
      "i love to have mine before my window and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work.\n",
      "i had an old axe which nobody claimed with which by spells in winter days on the sunny side of the house i played about the stumps which i had got out of my bean-field.\n",
      "as my driver prophesied when i was ploughing they warmed me twice once while i was splitting them and again when they were on the fire so that no fuel could give out more heat.\n",
      "as for the axe i was advised to get the village blacksmith to jump it but i jumped him and putting a hickory helve from the woods into it made it do.\n",
      "if it was dull it was at least hung true.\n",
      "a few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure.\n",
      "it is interesting to remember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth.\n",
      "in previous years i had often gone prospecting over some bare hill-side where a pitch-pine wood had formerly stood and got out the fat pine roots.\n",
      "they are almost indestructible.\n",
      "stumps thirty or forty years old at least will still be sound at the core though the sapwood has all become vegetable mould as appears by the scales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart.\n",
      "with axe and shovel you explore this mine and follow the marrowy store yellow as beef tallow or as if you had struck on a vein of gold deep into the earth.\n",
      "but commonly i kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest which i had stored up in my shed before the snow came.\n",
      "green hickory finely split makes the woodchoppers kindlings when he has a camp in the woods.\n",
      "once in a while i got a little of this.\n",
      "when the villagers were lighting their fires beyond the horizon i too gave notice to the various wild inhabitants of walden vale by a smoky streamer from my chimney that i was awake.\n",
      "—      light-winged smoke icarian bird      melting thy pinions in thy upward flight      lark without song and messenger of dawn      circling above the hamlets as thy nest      or else departing dream and shadowy form      of midnight vision gathering up thy skirts      by night star-veiling and by day      darkening the light and blotting out the sun      go thou my incense upward from this hearth      and ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.\n",
      "hard green wood just cut though i used but little of that answered my purpose better than any other.\n",
      "i sometimes left a good fire when i went to take a walk in a winter afternoon and when i returned three or four hours afterward it would be still alive and glowing.\n",
      "my house was not empty though i was gone.\n",
      "it was as if i had left a cheerful housekeeper behind.\n",
      "it was i and fire that lived there and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy.\n",
      "one day however as i was splitting wood i thought that i would just look in at the window and see if the house was not on fire it was the only time i remember to have been particularly anxious on this score so i looked and saw that a spark had caught my bed and i went in and extinguished it when it had burned a place as big as my hand.\n",
      "but my house occupied so sunny and sheltered a position and its roof was so low that i could afford to let the fire go out in the middle of almost any winter day.\n",
      "the moles nested in my cellar nibbling every third potato and making a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as man and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to secure them.\n",
      "some of my friends spoke as if i was coming to the woods on purpose to freeze myself.\n",
      "the animal merely makes a bed which he warms with his body in a sheltered place but man having discovered fire boxes up some air in a spacious apartment and warms that instead of robbing himself makes that his bed in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing maintain a kind of summer in the midst of winter and by means of windows even admit the light and with a lamp lengthen out the day.\n",
      "thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct and saves a little time for the fine arts.\n",
      "though when i had been exposed to the rudest blasts a long time my whole body began to grow torpid when i reached the genial atmosphere of my house i soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my life.\n",
      "but the most luxuriously housed has little to boast of in this respect nor need we trouble ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed.\n",
      "it would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast from the north.\n",
      "we go on dating from cold fridays and great snows but a little colder friday or greater snow would put a period to mans existence on the globe.\n",
      "the next winter i used a small cooking-stove for economy since i did not own the forest but it did not keep fire so well as the open fire-place.\n",
      "cooking was then for the most part no longer a poetic but merely a chemic process.\n",
      "it will soon be forgotten in these days of stoves that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes after the indian fashion.\n",
      "the stove not only took up room and scented the house but it concealed the fire and i felt as if i had lost a companion.\n",
      "you can always see a face in the fire.\n",
      "the laborer looking into it at evening purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day.\n",
      "but i could no longer sit and look into the fire and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force.\n",
      "—      never bright flame may be denied to me      thy dear life imaging close sympathy.\n",
      "     what but my hopes shot upward eer so bright.\n",
      "     what but my fortunes sunk so low in night.\n",
      "     why art thou banished from our hearth and hall      thou who art welcomed and beloved by all.\n",
      "     was thy existence then too fanciful      for our lifes common light who are so dull.\n",
      "     did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold      with our congenial souls.\n",
      "secrets too bold.\n",
      "     well we are safe and strong for now we sit      beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit      where nothing cheers nor saddens but a fire      warms feet and hands—nor does to more aspire      by whose compact utilitarian heap      the present may sit down and go to sleep      nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked      and with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked.\n",
      "  former inhabitants and winter visitors i weathered some merry snow storms and spent some cheerful winter evenings by my fire-side while the snow whirled wildly without and even the hooting of the owl was hushed.\n",
      "for many weeks i met no one in my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the village.\n",
      "the elements however abetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods for when i had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my tracks where they lodged and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted the snow and so not only made a dry bed for my feet but in the night their dark line was my guide.\n",
      "for human society i was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these woods.\n",
      "within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants and the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings though it was then much more shut in by the forest than now.\n",
      "in some places within my own remembrance the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once and women and children who were compelled to go this way to lincoln alone and on foot did it with fear and often ran a good part of the distance.\n",
      "though mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages or for the woodmans team it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety and lingered longer in his memory.\n",
      "where now firm open fields stretch from the village to the woods it then ran through a maple swamp on a foundation of logs the remnants of which doubtless still underlie the present dusty highway from the stratton now the alms house farm to bristers hill.\n",
      "east of my bean-field across the road lived cato ingraham slave of duncan ingraham esquire gentleman of concord village who built his slave a house and gave him permission to live in walden woods—cato not uticensis but concordiensis.\n",
      "some say that he was a guinea negro.\n",
      "there are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts which he let grow up till he should be old and need them but a younger and whiter speculator got them at last.\n",
      "he too however occupies an equally narrow house at present.\n",
      "catos half-obliterated cellar hole still remains though known to few being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines.\n",
      "it is now filled with the smooth sumach rhus glabra and one of the earliest species of golden-rod solidago stricta grows there luxuriantly.\n",
      "here by the very corner of my field still nearer to town zilpha a colored woman had her little house where she spun linen for the townsfolk making the walden woods ring with her shrill singing for she had a loud and notable voice.\n",
      "at length in the war of 1812 her dwelling was set on fire by english soldiers prisoners on parole when she was away and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together.\n",
      "she led a hard life and somewhat inhumane.\n",
      "one old frequenter of these woods remembers that as he passed her house one noon he heard her muttering to herself over her gurgling pot—ye are all bones bones i have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.\n",
      "down the road on the right hand on bristers hill lived brister freeman a handy negro slave of squire cummings once—there where grow still the apple-trees which brister planted and tended large old trees now but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste.\n",
      "not long since i read his epitaph in the old lincoln burying-ground a little on one side near the unmarked graves of some british grenadiers who fell in the retreat from concord—where he is styled sippio brister—scipio africanus he had some title to be called—a man of color as if he were discolored.\n",
      "it also told me with staring emphasis when he died which was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived.\n",
      "with him dwelt fenda his hospitable wife who told fortunes yet pleasantly—large round and black blacker than any of the children of night such a dusky orb as never rose on concord before or since.\n",
      "farther down the hill on the left on the old road in the woods are marks of some homestead of the stratton family whose orchard once covered all the slope of bristers hill but was long since killed out by pitch pines excepting a few stumps whose old roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree.\n",
      "nearer yet to town you come to breeds location on the other side of the way just on the edge of the wood ground famous for the pranks of a demon not distinctly named in old mythology who has acted a prominent and astounding part in our new england life and deserves as much as any mythological character to have his biography written one day who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man and then robs and murders the whole family—new-england rum.\n",
      "but history must not yet tell the tragedies enacted here let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them.\n",
      "here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood the well the same which tempered the travellers beverage and refreshed his steed.\n",
      "here then men saluted one another and heard and told the news and went their ways again.\n",
      "breeds hut was standing only a dozen years ago though it had long been unoccupied.\n",
      "it was about the size of mine.\n",
      "it was set on fire by mischievous boys one election night if i do not mistake.\n",
      "i lived on the edge of the village then and had just lost myself over davenants gondibert that winter that i labored with a lethargy—which by the way i never knew whether to regard as a family complaint having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a cellar sundays in order to keep awake and keep the sabbath or as the consequence of my attempt to read chalmers collection of english poetry without skipping.\n",
      "it fairly overcame my nervii.\n",
      "i had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire and in hot haste the engines rolled that way led by a straggling troop of men and boys and i among the foremost for i had leaped the brook.\n",
      "we thought it was far south over the woods—we who had run to fires before—barn shop or dwelling-house or all together.\n",
      "its bakers barn cried one.\n",
      "it is the codman place affirmed another.\n",
      "and then fresh sparks went up above the wood as if the roof fell in and we all shouted concord to the rescue wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads bearing perchance among the rest the agent of the insurance company who was bound to go however far and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind more slow and sure and rearmost of all as it was afterward whispered came they who set the fire and gave the alarm.\n",
      "thus we kept on like true idealists rejecting the evidence of our senses until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall and realized alas that we were there.\n",
      "the very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor.\n",
      "at first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to it but concluded to let it burn it was so far gone and so worthless.\n",
      "so we stood round our engine jostled one another expressed our sentiments through speaking-trumpets or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the world has witnessed including bascoms shop and between ourselves we thought that were we there in season with our tub and a full frog-pond by we could turn that threatened last and universal one into another flood.\n",
      "we finally retreated without doing any mischief—returned to sleep and gondibert.\n",
      "but as for gondibert i would except that passage in the preface about wit being the souls powder—but most of mankind are strangers to wit as indians are to powder.\n",
      " it chanced that i walked that way across the fields the following night about the same hour and hearing a low moaning at this spot i drew near in the dark and discovered the only survivor of the family that i know the heir of both its virtues and its vices who alone was interested in this burning lying on his stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath muttering to himself as is his wont.\n",
      "he had been working far off in the river meadows all day and had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth.\n",
      "he gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns always lying down to it as if there was some treasure which he remembered concealed between the stones where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes.\n",
      "the house being gone he looked at what there was left.\n",
      "he was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence implied and showed me as well as the darkness permitted where the well was covered up which thank heaven could never be burned and he groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had cut and mounted feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the heavy end—all that he could now cling to—to convince me that it was no common rider.\n",
      " i felt it and still remark it almost daily in my walks for by it hangs the history of a family.\n",
      "once more on the left where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall in the now open field lived nutting and le grosse.\n",
      "but to return toward lincoln.\n",
      "farther in the woods than any of these where the road approaches nearest to the pond wyman the potter squatted and furnished his townsmen with earthen ware and left descendants to succeed him.\n",
      "neither were they rich in worldly goods holding the land by sufferance while they lived and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect the taxes and attached a chip for forms sake as i have read in his accounts there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on.\n",
      "one day in midsummer when i was hoeing a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired concerning wyman the younger.\n",
      "he had long ago bought a potters wheel of him and wished to know what had become of him.\n",
      "i had read of the potters clay and wheel in scripture but it had never occurred to me that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those days or grown on trees like gourds somewhere and i was pleased to hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.\n",
      "the last inhabitant of these woods before me was an irishman hugh quoil if i have spelt his name with coil enough who occupied wymans tenement—col.\n",
      "quoil he was called.\n",

      "napoleon went to st.\n",
      "helena quoil came to walden woods.\n",
      "all i know of him is tragic.\n",
      "he was a man of manners like one who had seen the world and was capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to.\n",
      "he wore a great coat in mid-summer being affected with the trembling delirium and his face was the color of carmine.\n",
      "he died in the road at the foot of bristers hill shortly after i came to the woods so that i have not remembered him as a neighbor.\n",
      "before his house was pulled down when his comrades avoided it as an unlucky castle i visited it.\n",
      "there lay his old clothes curled up by use as if they were himself upon his raised plank bed.\n",
      "his pipe lay broken on the hearth instead of a bowl broken at the fountain.\n",
      "the last could never have been the symbol of his death for he confessed to me that though he had heard of bristers spring he had never seen it and soiled cards kings of diamonds spades and hearts were scattered over the floor.\n",
      "one black chicken which the administrator could not catch black as night and as silent not even croaking awaiting reynard still went to roost in the next apartment.\n",
      "in the rear there was the dim outline of a garden which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing owing to those terrible shaking fits though it was now harvest time.\n",
      "it was over-run with roman wormwood and beggar-ticks which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit.\n",
      "the skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the house a trophy of his last waterloo but no warm cap or mittens would he want more.\n",
      "now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings with buried cellar stones and strawberries raspberries thimble-berries hazel-bushes and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there some pitch-pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook and a sweet-scented black-birch perhaps waves where the door-stone was.\n",
      "sometimes the well dent is visible where once a spring oozed now dry and tearless grass or it was covered deep—not to be discovered till some late day—with a flat stone under the sod when the last of the race departed.\n",
      "what a sorrowful act must that be—the covering up of wells coincident with the opening of wells of tears.\n",
      "these cellar dents like deserted fox burrows old holes are all that is left where once were the stir and bustle of human life and fate free-will foreknowledge absolute in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed.\n",
      "but all i can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this that cato and brister pulled wool which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy.\n",
      "still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the sill are gone unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring to be plucked by the musing traveller planted and tended once by childrens hands in front-yard plots—now standing by wall-sides in retired pastures and giving place to new-rising forests—the last of that stirp sole survivor of that family.\n",
      "little did the dusky children think that the puny slip with its two eyes only which they stuck in the ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered would root itself so and outlive them and house itself in the rear that shaded it and grown mans garden and orchard and tell their story faintly to the lone wanderer a half century after they had grown up and died—blossoming as fair and smelling as sweet as in that first spring.\n",
      "i mark its still tender civil cheerful lilac colors.\n",
      "but this small village germ of something more why did it fail while concord keeps its ground.\n",
      "were there no natural advantages—no water privileges forsooth.\n",

      "they were universally a thirsty race.\n",
      "might not the basket stable-broom mat-making corn-parching linen-spinning and pottery business have thrived here making the wilderness to blossom like the rose and a numerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers.\n",
      "the sterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-land degeneracy.\n",
      "alas how little does the memory of these human inhabitants enhance the beauty of the landscape again perhaps nature will try with me for a first settler and my house raised last spring to be the oldest in the hamlet.\n",

      " at this season i seldom had a visitor.\n",
      "when the snow lay deepest no wanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time but there i lived as snug as a meadow mouse or as cattle and poultry which are said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts even without food or like that early settlers family in the town of sutton in this state whose cottage was completely covered by the great snow of 1717 when he was absent and an indian found it only by the hole which the chimneys breath made in the drift and so relieved the family.\n",
      "but no friendly indian concerned himself about me nor needed he for the master of the house was at home.\n",
      "the great snow how cheerful it is to hear of when the farmers could not get to the woods and swamps with their teams and were obliged to cut down the shade trees before their houses and when the crust was harder cut off the trees in the swamps ten feet from the ground as it appeared the next spring.\n",
      "in the deepest snows the path which i used from the highway to my house about half a mile long might have been represented by a meandering dotted line with wide intervals between the dots.\n",
      "for a week of even weather i took exactly the same number of steps and of the same length coming and going stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks—to such routine the winter reduces us—yet often they were filled with heavens own blue.\n",
      "but no weather interfered fatally with my walks or rather my going abroad for i frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree or a yellow-birch or an old acquaintance among the pines when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop and so sharpening their tops had changed the pines into fir-trees wading to the tops of the highest hills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees when the hunters had gone into winter quarters.\n",
      "one afternoon i amused myself by watching a barred owl strix nebulosa sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white-pine close to the trunk in broad daylight i standing within a rod of him.\n",
      "he could hear me when i moved and cronched the snow with my feet but could not plainly see me.\n",
      "when i made most noise he would stretch out his neck and erect his neck feathers and open his eyes wide but their lids soon fell again and he began to nod.\n",
      "i too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour as he sat thus with his eyes half open like a cat winged brother of the cat.\n",
      "there was only a narrow slit left between their lids by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me thus with half-shut eyes looking out from the land of dreams and endeavoring to realize me vague object or mote that interrupted his visions.\n",
      "at length on some louder noise or my nearer approach he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines spreading his wings to unexpected breadth i could not hear the slightest sound from them.\n",
      "thus guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight feeling his twilight way as it were with his sensitive pinions he found a new perch where he might in peace await the dawning of his day.\n",
      "as i walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows i encountered many a blustering and nipping wind for nowhere has it freer play and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek heathen as i was i turned to it the other also.\n",
      "nor was it much better by the carriage road from bristers hill.\n",
      "for i came to town still like a friendly indian when the contents of the broad open fields were all piled up between the walls of the walden road and half an hour sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller.\n",
      "and when i returned new drifts would have formed through which i floundered where the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snow round a sharp angle in the road and not a rabbits track nor even the fine print the small type of a meadow mouse was to be seen.\n",
      "yet i rarely failed to find even in mid-winter some warm and springly swamp where the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial verdure and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of spring.\n",
      "sometimes notwithstanding the snow when i returned from my walk at evening i crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth and my house filled with the odor of his pipe.\n",
      "or on a sunday afternoon if i chanced to be at home i heard the cronching of the snow made by the step of a long-headed farmer who from far through the woods sought my house to have a social crack one of the few of his vocation who are men on their farms who donned a frock instead of a professors gown and is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barn-yard.\n",
      "we talked of rude and simple times when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather with clear heads and when other dessert failed we tried our teeth on many a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned for those which have the thickest shells are commonly empty.\n",
      "the one who came from farthest to my lodge through deepest snows and most dismal tempests was a poet.\n",
      "a farmer a hunter a soldier a reporter even a philosopher may be daunted but nothing can deter a poet for he is actuated by pure love.\n",
      "who can predict his comings and goings.\n",
      "his business calls him out at all hours even when doctors sleep.\n",
      "we made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk making amends then to walden vale for the long silences.\n",
      "broadway was still and deserted in comparison.\n",
      "at suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter which might have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or the forth-coming jest.\n",
      "we made many a bran new theory of life over a thin dish of gruel which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clear-headedness which philosophy requires.\n",
      "i should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another welcome visitor who at one time came through the village through snow and rain and darkness till he saw my lamp through the trees and shared with me some long winter evenings.\n",
      "one of the last of the philosophers—connecticut gave him to the world—he peddled first her wares afterwards as he declares his brains.\n",
      "these he peddles still prompting god and disgracing man bearing for fruit his brain only like the nut its kernel.\n",
      "i think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive.\n",
      "his words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are acquainted with and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve.\n",
      "he has no venture in the present.\n",
      "but though comparatively disregarded now when his day comes laws unsuspected by most will take effect and masters of families and rulers will come to him for advice.\n",
      "—      how blind that cannot see serenity  a true friend of man almost the only friend of human progress.\n",
      "an old mortality say rather an immortality with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in mens bodies the god of whom they are but defaced and leaning monuments.\n",
      "with his hospitable intellect he embraces children beggars insane and scholars and entertains the thought of all adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance.\n",
      "i think that he should keep a caravansary on the worlds highway where philosophers of all nations might put up and on his sign should be printed entertainment for man but not for his beast.\n",
      "enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind who earnestly seek the right road.\n",
      " he is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any i chance to know the same yesterday and tomorrow.\n",
      "of yore we had sauntered and talked and effectually put the world behind us for he was pledged to no institution in it freeborn ingenuus.\n",

      "a blue-robed man whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity.\n",
      "i do not see how he can ever die nature cannot spare him.\n",
      "having each some shingles of thought well dried we sat and whittled them trying our knives and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine.\n",
      "we waded so gently and reverently or we pulled together so smoothly that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream nor feared any angler on the bank but came and went grandly like the clouds which float through the western sky and the mother-o-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there.\n",
      "there we worked revising mythology rounding a fable here and there and building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy foundation.\n",
      "great looker great expecter to converse with whom was a new england nights entertainment.\n",
      "ah such discourse we had hermit and philosopher and the old settler i have spoken of—we three—it expanded and racked my little house i should not dare to say how many pounds weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular inch it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak—but i had enough of that kind of oakum already picked.\n",
      "there was one other with whom i had solid seasons long to be remembered at his house in the village and who looked in upon me from time to time but i had no more for society there.\n",
      "there too as every where i sometimes expected the visitor who never comes.\n",
      "the vishnu purana says the house-holder is to remain at eventide in his court-yard as long as it takes to milk a cow or longer if he pleases to await the arrival of a guest.\n",
      " i often performed this duty of hospitality waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows but did not see the man approaching from the town.\n",
      " winter animals when the ponds were firmly frozen they afforded not only new and shorter routes to many points but new views from their surfaces of the familiar landscape around them.\n",
      "when i crossed flints pond after it was covered with snow though i had often paddled about and skated over it it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that i could think of nothing but baffins bay.\n",
      "the lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a snowy plain in which i did not remember to have stood before and the fishermen at an indeterminable distance over the ice moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs passed for sealers or esquimaux or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures and i did not know whether they were giants or pygmies.\n",
      "i took this course when i went to lecture in lincoln in the evening travelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room.\n",
      "in goose pond which lay in my way a colony of muskrats dwelt and raised their cabins high above the ice though none could be seen abroad when i crossed it.\n",
      "walden being like the rest usually bare of snow or with only shallow and interrupted drifts on it was my yard where i could walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to their streets.\n",
      "there far from the village street and except at very long intervals from the jingle of sleigh-bells i slid and skated as in a vast moose-yard well trodden overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling with icicles.\n",
      "for sounds in winter nights and often in winter days i heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum the very lingua vernacula of walden wood and quite familiar to me at last though i never saw the bird while it was making it.\n",
      "i seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it hoo hoo hoo hoorer hoo sounded sonorously and the first three syllables accented somewhat like how der do or sometimes hoo hoo only.\n",
      "one night in the beginning of winter before the pond froze over about nine oclock i was startled by the loud honking of a goose and stepping to the door heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house.\n",
      "they passed over the pond toward fair haven seemingly deterred from settling by my light their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat.\n",
      "suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very near me with the most harsh and tremendous voice i ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods responded at regular intervals to the goose as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from hudsons bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native and boo-hoo him out of concord horizon.\n",
      "what do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me.\n",
      "do you think i am ever caught napping at such an hour and that i have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself.\n",
      "boo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo it was one of the most thrilling discords i ever heard.\n",
      "and yet if you had a discriminating ear there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard.\n",
      "i also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond my great bed-fellow in that part of concord as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over were troubled with flatulency and had dreams or i was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost as if some one had driven a team against my door and in the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide.\n",
      "sometimes i heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust in moonlight nights in search of a partridge or other game barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs as if laboring with some anxiety or seeking expression struggling for light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets for if we take the ages into our account may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men.\n",
      "they seemed to me to be rudimental burrowing men still standing on their defence awaiting their transformation.\n",
      "sometimes one came near to my window attracted by my light barked a vulpine curse at me and then retreated.\n",
      "usually the red squirrel sciurus hudsonius waked me in the dawn coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house as if sent out of the woods for this purpose.\n",
      "in the course of the winter i threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet-corn which had not got ripe on to the snow crust by my door and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it.\n",
      "in the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal.\n",
      "all day long the red squirrels came and went and afforded me much entertainment by their manœuvres.\n",
      "one would approach at first warily through the shrub-oaks running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind now a few paces this way with wonderful speed and waste of energy making inconceivable haste with his trotters as if it were for a wager and now as many paces that way but never getting on more than half a rod at a time and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset as if all the eyes in the universe were fixed on him—for all the motions of a squirrel even in the most solitary recesses of the forest imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girl—wasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance—i never saw one walk—and then suddenly before you could say jack robinson he would be in the top of a young pitch-pine winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time—for no reason that i could ever detect or he himself was aware of i suspect.\n",
      "at length he would reach the corn and selecting a suitable ear frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pile before my window where he looked me in the face and there sit for hours supplying himself with a new ear from time to time nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food tasting only the inside of the kernel and the ear which was held balanced over the stick by one paw slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty as if suspecting that it had life with a mind not made up whether to get it again or a new one or be off now thinking of corn then listening to hear what was in the wind.\n",
      "so the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon till at last seizing some longer and plumper one considerably bigger than himself and skilfully balancing it he would set out with it to the woods like a tiger with a buffalo by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the while making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal being determined to put it through at any rate—a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow—and so he would get off with it to where he lived perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant and i would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various directions.\n",
      "at length the jays arrive whose discordant screams were heard long before as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree nearer and nearer and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped.\n",
      "then sitting on a pitch-pine bough they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them and after great labor they disgorge it and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills.\n",
      "they were manifestly thieves and i had not much respect for them but the squirrels though at first shy went to work as if they were taking what was their own.\n",
      "meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks which picking up the crumbs the squirrels had dropped flew to the nearest twig and placing them under their claws hammered away at them with their little bills as if it were an insect in the bark till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats.\n",
      "a little flock of these tit-mice came daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile or the crumbs at my door with faint flitting lisping notes like the tinkling of icicles in the grass or else with sprightly day day day or more rarely in spring-like days a wiry summery phe-be from the wood-side.\n",
      "they were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which i was carrying in and pecked at the sticks without fear.\n",
      "i once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while i was hoeing in a village garden and i felt that i was more distinguished by that circumstance than i should have been by any epaulet i could have worn.\n",
      "the squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar and occasionally stepped upon my shoe when that was the nearest way.\n",
      "when the ground was not yet quite covered and again near the end of winter when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my wood-pile the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there.\n",
      "whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dust for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter.\n",
      "it is frequently covered up by drifts and it is said sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow where it remains concealed for a day or two.\n",
      " i used to start them in the open land also where they had come out of the woods at sunset to bud the wild apple-trees.\n",
      "they will come regularly every evening to particular trees where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little.\n",
      "i am glad that the partridge gets fed at any rate.\n",
      "it is natures own bird which lives on buds and diet-drink.\n",
      "in dark winter mornings or in short winter afternoons i sometimes heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp unable to resist the instinct of the chase and the note of the hunting horn at intervals proving that man was in the rear.\n",
      "the woods ring again and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond nor following pack pursuing their actæon.\n",
      "and perhaps at evening i see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy seeking their inn.\n",
      "they tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe or if he would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake him but having left his pursuers far behind he stops to rest and listen till they come up and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts where the hunters await him.\n",
      "sometimes however he will run upon a wall many rods and then leap off far to one side and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent.\n",
      "a hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles run part way across and then return to the same shore.\n",
      "ere long the hounds arrived but here they lost the scent.\n",
      "sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door and circle round my house and yelp and hound without regarding me as if afflicted by a species of madness so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit.\n",
      "thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox for a wise hound will forsake every thing else for this.\n",
      "one day a man came to my hut from lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track and had been hunting for a week by himself.\n",
      "but i fear that he was not the wiser for all i told him for every time i attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking what do you do here.\n",
      " he had lost a dog but found a man.\n",
      "one old hunter who has a dry tongue who used to come to bathe in walden once every year when the water was warmest and at such times looked in upon me told me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in walden wood and as he walked the wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road and his swift bullet had not touched him.\n",
      "some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit hunting on their own account and disappeared again in the woods.\n",
      "late in the afternoon as he was resting in the thick woods south of walden he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward fair haven still pursuing the fox and on they came their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer now from well-meadow now from the baker farm.\n",
      "for a long time he stood still and listened to their music so sweet to a hunters ear when suddenly the fox appeared threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves swift and still keeping the ground leaving his pursuers far behind and leaping upon a rock amid the woods he sat erect and listening with his back to the hunter.\n",
      "for a moment compassion restrained the latters arm but that was a short-lived mood and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled and whang—the fox rolling over the rock lay dead on the ground.\n",
      "the hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds.\n",
      "still on they came and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry.\n",
      "at length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground and snapping the air as if possessed and ran directly to the rock but spying the dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement and walked round and round him in silence and one by one her pups arrived and like their mother were sobered into silence by the mystery.\n",
      "then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst and the mystery was solved.\n",
      "they waited in silence while he skinned the fox then followed the brush a while and at length turned off into the woods again.\n",
      "that evening a weston squire came to the concord hunters cottage to inquire for his hounds and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from weston woods.\n",
      "the concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin but the other declined it and departed.\n",
      "he did not find his hounds that night but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house for the night whence having been well fed they took their departure early in the morning.\n",
      "the hunter who told me this could remember one sam nutting who used to hunt bears on fair haven ledges and exchange their skins for rum in concord village who told him even that he had seen a moose there.\n",
      "nutting had a famous fox-hound named burgoyne—he pronounced it bugine—which my informant used to borrow.\n",
      "in the wast book of an old trader of this town who was also a captain town-clerk and representative i find the following entry.\n",
      "jan.\n",
      "18th 1742–3 john melven cr.\n",
      "by 1 grey fox 0—2—3 they are not now found here and in his ledger feb.\n",
      "7th 1743 hezekiah stratton has credit by ½ a catt skin 0—1—4½ of course a wild-cat for stratton was a sergeant in the old french war and would not have got credit for hunting less noble game.\n",
      "credit is given for deer skins also and they were daily sold.\n",
      "one man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which his uncle was engaged.\n",
      "the hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here.\n",
      "i remember well one gaunt nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the road-side and play a strain on it wilder and more melodious if my memory serves me than any hunting-horn.\n",
      "at midnight when there was a moon i sometimes met with hounds in my path prowling about the woods which would skulk out of my way as if afraid and stand silent amid the bushes till i had passed.\n",
      "squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts.\n",
      "there were scores of pitch-pines around my house from one to four inches in diameter which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter—a norwegian winter for them for the snow lay long and deep and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other diet.\n",
      "these trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summer and many of them had grown a foot though completely girdled but after another winter such were without exception dead.\n",
      "it is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner gnawing round instead of up and down it but perhaps it is necessary in order to thin these trees which are wont to grow up densely.\n",
      "the hares lepus americanus were very familiar.\n",
      "one had her form under my house all winter separated from me only by the flooring and she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when i began to stir—thump thump thump striking her head against the floor timbers in her hurry.\n",
      "they used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which i had thrown out and were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still.\n",
      "sometimes in the twilight i alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window.\n",
      "when i opened my door in the evening off they would go with a squeak and a bounce.\n",
      "near at hand they only excited my pity.\n",
      "one evening one sat by my door two paces from me at first trembling with fear yet unwilling to move a poor wee thing lean and bony with ragged ears and sharp nose scant tail and slender paws.\n",
      "it looked as if nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods but stood on her last toes.\n",
      "its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy almost dropsical.\n",
      "i took a step and lo away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow crust straightening its body and its limbs into graceful length and soon put the forest between me and itself—the wild free venison asserting its vigor and the dignity of nature.\n",
      "not without reason was its slenderness.\n",
      "such then was its nature.\n",
      "lepus levipes light-foot some think.\n",
      " what is a country without rabbits and partridges.\n",
      "they are among the most simple and indigenous animal products ancient and venerable families known to antiquity as to modern times of the very hue and substance of nature nearest allied to leaves and to the ground—and to one another it is either winged or it is legged.\n",
      "it is hardly as if you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away only a natural one as much to be expected as rustling leaves.\n",
      "the partridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive like true natives of the soil whatever revolutions occur.\n",
      "if the forest is cut off the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment and they become more numerous than ever.\n",
      "that must be a poor country indeed that does not support a hare.\n",
      "our woods teem with them both and around every swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk beset with twiggy fences and horse-hair snares which some cow-boy tends.\n",
      " the pond in winter after a still winter night i awoke with the impression that some question had been put to me which i had been endeavoring in vain to answer in my sleep as what—how—when—where.\n",
      "but there was dawning nature in whom all creatures live looking in at my broad windows with serene and satisfied face and no question on her lips.\n",
      "i awoke to an answered question to nature and daylight.\n",
      "the snow lying deep on the earth dotted with young pines and the very slope of the hill on which my house is placed seemed to say forward nature puts no question and answers none which we mortals ask.\n",
      "she has long ago taken her resolution.\n",
      "o prince our eyes contemplate with admiration and transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this universe.\n",
      "the night veils without doubt a part of this glorious creation but day comes to reveal to us this great work which extends from earth even into the plains of the ether.\n",
      " then to my morning work.\n",
      "first i take an axe and pail and go in search of water if that be not a dream.\n",
      "after a cold and snowy night it needed a divining rod to find it.\n",
      "every winter the liquid and trembling surface of the pond which was so sensitive to every breath and reflected every light and shadow becomes solid to the depth of a foot or a foot and a half so that it will support the heaviest teams and perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth and it is not to be distinguished from any level field.\n",
      "like the marmots in the surrounding hills it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three months or more.\n",
      "standing on the snow-covered plain as if in a pasture amid the hills i cut my way first through a foot of snow and then a foot of ice and open a window under my feet where kneeling to drink i look down into the quiet parlor of the fishes pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground glass with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky corresponding to the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants.\n",
      "heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.\n",
      "early in the morning while all things are crisp with frost men come with fishing reels and slender lunch and let down their fine lines through the snowy field to take pickerel and perch wild men who instinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than their townsmen and by their goings and comings stitch towns together in parts where else they would be ripped.\n",
      "they sit and eat their luncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore as wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial.\n",
      "they never consulted with books and know and can tell much less than they have done.\n",
      "the things which they practise are said not yet to be known.\n",
      "here is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait.\n",
      "you look into his pail with wonder as into a summer pond as if he kept summer locked up at home or knew where she had retreated.\n",
      "how pray did he get these in mid-winter.\n",
      "o he got worms out of rotten logs since the ground froze and so he caught them.\n",
      "his life itself passes deeper in nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate himself a subject for the naturalist.\n",
      "the latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of insects the former lays open logs to their core with his axe and moss and bark fly far and wide.\n",
      "he gets his living by barking trees.\n",
      "such a man has some right to fish and i love to see nature carried out in him.\n",
      "the perch swallows the grub-worm the pickerel swallows the perch and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled.\n",
      "when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was sometimes amused by the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted.\n",
      "he would perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder a foot or more above the ice and tied a dry oak leaf to it which being pulled down would show when he had a bite.\n",
      "these alders loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way round the pond.\n",
      "ah the pickerel of walden when i see them lying on the ice or in the well which the fisherman cuts in the ice making a little hole to admit the water i am always surprised by their rare beauty as if they were fabulous fishes they are so foreign to the streets even to the woods foreign as arabia to our concord life.\n",
      "they possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets.\n",
      "they are not green like the pines nor gray like the stones nor blue like the sky but they have to my eyes if possible yet rarer colors like flowers and precious stones as if they were the pearls the animalized nuclei or crystals of the walden water.\n",
      "they of course are walden all over and all through are themselves small waldens in the animal kingdom waldenses.\n",
      "it is surprising that they are caught here—that in this deep and capacious spring far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the walden road this great gold and emerald fish swims.\n",
      "i never chanced to see its kind in any market it would be the cynosure of all eyes there.\n",
      "easily with a few convulsive quirks they give up their watery ghosts like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven.\n",
      " waldenpondmap  as i was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of walden pond i surveyed it carefully before the ice broke up early in 46 with compass and chain and sounding line.\n",
      "there have been many stories told about the bottom or rather no bottom of this pond which certainly had no foundation for themselves.\n",
      "it is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it.\n",
      "i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in this neighborhood.\n",
      "many have believed that walden reached quite through to the other side of the globe.\n",
      "some who have lain flat on the ice for a long time looking down through the illusive medium perchance with watery eyes into the bargain and driven to hasty conclusions by the fear of catching cold in their breasts have seen vast holes into which a load of hay might be driven if there were any body to drive it the undoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernal regions from these parts.\n",
      "others have gone down from the village with a fifty-six and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have failed to find any bottom for while the fifty-six was resting by the way they were paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for marvellousness.\n",
      "but i can assure my readers that walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable though at an unusual depth.\n",
      "i fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone weighing about a pound and a half and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom by having to pull so much harder before the water got underneath to help me.\n",
      "the greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet to which may be added the five feet which it has risen since making one hundred and seven.\n",
      "this is a remarkable depth for so small an area yet not an inch of it can be spared by the imagination.\n",
      "what if all ponds were shallow.\n",
      "would it not react on the minds of men.\n",
      "i am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol.\n",
      "while men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless.\n",
      "a factory owner hearing what depth i had found thought that it could not be true for judging from his acquaintance with dams sand would not lie at so steep an angle.\n",
      "but the deepest ponds are not so deep in proportion to their area as most suppose and if drained would not leave very remarkable valleys.\n",
      "they are not like cups between the hills for this one which is so unusually deep for its area appears in a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallow plate.\n",
      "most ponds emptied would leave a meadow no more hollow than we frequently see.\n",
      "william gilpin who is so admirable in all that relates to landscapes and usually so correct standing at the head of loch fyne in scotland which he describes as a bay of salt water sixty or seventy fathoms deep four miles in breadth and about fifty miles long surrounded by mountains observes if we could have seen it immediately after the diluvian crash or whatever convulsion of nature occasioned it before the waters gushed in what a horrid chasm must it have appeared      so high as heaved the tumid hills so low      down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep      capacious bed of waters—.\n",
      " but if using the shortest diameter of loch fyne we apply these proportions to walden which as we have seen appears already in a vertical section only like a shallow plate it will appear four times as shallow.\n",
      "so much for the increased horrors of the chasm of loch fyne when emptied.\n",
      "no doubt many a smiling valley with its stretching cornfields occupies exactly such a horrid chasm from which the waters have receded though it requires the insight and the far sight of the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact.\n",
      "often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in the low horizon hills and no subsequent elevation of the plain has been necessary to conceal their history.\n",
      "but it is easiest as they who work on the highways know to find the hollows by the puddles after a shower.\n",
      "the amount of it is the imagination give it the least license dives deeper and soars higher than nature goes.\n",
      "so probably the depth of the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its breadth.\n",
      "as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottom with greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do not freeze over and i was surprised at its general regularity.\n",
      "in the deepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field which is exposed to the sun wind and plough.\n",
      "in one instance on a line arbitrarily chosen the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty rods and generally near the middle i could calculate the variation for each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or four inches.\n",
      "some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes even in quiet sandy ponds like this but the effect of water under these circumstances is to level all inequalities.\n",
      "the regularity of the bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the neighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the soundings quite across the pond and its direction could be determined by observing the opposite shore.\n",
      "cape becomes bar and plain shoal and valley and gorge deep water and channel.\n",
      "when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch and put down the soundings more than a hundred in all i observed this remarkable coincidence.\n",
      "having noticed that the number indicating the greatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map i laid a rule on the map lengthwise and then breadthwise and found to my surprise that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest breadth exactly at the point of greatest depth notwithstanding that the middle is so nearly level the outline of the pond far from regular and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into the coves and i said to myself who knows but this hint would conduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle.\n",
      "is not this the rule also for the height of mountains regarded as the opposite of valleys.\n",
      "we know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part.\n",
      "of five coves three or all which had been sounded were observed to have a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within so that the bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only horizontally but vertically and to form a basin or independent pond the direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar.\n",
      "every harbor on the sea-coast also has its bar at its entrance.\n",
      "in proportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length the water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin.\n",
      "given then the length and breadth of the cove and the character of the surrounding shore and you have almost elements enough to make out a formula for all cases.\n",
      "in order to see how nearly i could guess with this experience at the deepest point in a pond by observing the outlines of its surface and the character of its shores alone i made a plan of white pond which contains about forty-one acres and like this has no island in it nor any visible inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadth fell very near the line of least breadth where two opposite capes approached each other and two opposite bays receded i ventured to mark a point a short distance from the latter line but still on the line of greatest length as the deepest.\n",
      "the deepest part was found to be within one hundred feet of this still farther in the direction to which i had inclined and was only one foot deeper namely sixty feet.\n",
      "of course a stream running through or an island in the pond would make the problem much more complicated.\n",
      "if we knew all the laws of nature we should need only one fact or the description of one actual phenomenon to infer all the particular results at that point.\n",
      "now we know only a few laws and our result is vitiated not of course by any confusion or irregularity in nature but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation.\n",
      "our notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances which we detect but the harmony which results from a far greater number of seemingly conflicting but really concurring laws which we have not detected is still more wonderful.\n",
      "the particular laws are as our points of view as to the traveller a mountain outline varies with every step and it has an infinite number of profiles though absolutely but one form.\n",
      "even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended in its entireness.\n",
      "what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics.\n",
      "it is the law of average.\n",
      "such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us toward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draw lines through the length and breadth of the aggregate of a mans particular daily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets and where they intersect will be the height or depth of his character.\n",
      "perhaps we need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or circumstances to infer his depth and concealed bottom.\n",
      "if he is surrounded by mountainous circumstances an achillean shore whose peaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom they suggest a corresponding depth in him.\n",
      "but a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that side.\n",
      "in our bodies a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a corresponding depth of thought.\n",
      "also there is a bar across the entrance of our every cove or particular inclination each is our harbor for a season in which we are detained and partially land-locked.\n",
      "these inclinations are not whimsical usually but their form size and direction are determined by the promontories of the shore the ancient axes of elevation.\n",
      "when this bar is gradually increased by storms tides or currents or there is a subsidence of the waters so that it reaches to the surface that which was at first but an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an individual lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought secures its own conditions changes perhaps from salt to fresh becomes a sweet sea dead sea or a marsh.\n",
      "at the advent of each individual into this life may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface somewhere.\n",
      "it is true we are such poor navigators that our thoughts for the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast are conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy or steer for the public ports of entry and go into the dry docks of science where they merely refit for this world and no natural currents concur to individualize them.\n",
      "as for the inlet or outlet of walden i have not discovered any but rain and snow and evaporation though perhaps with a thermometer and a line such places may be found for where the water flows into the pond it will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter.\n",
      "when the ice-men were at work here in 46–7 the cakes sent to the shore were one day rejected by those who were stacking them up there not being thick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutters thus discovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inches thinner than elsewhere which made them think that there was an inlet there.\n",
      "they also showed me in another place what they thought was a leach hole through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a neighboring meadow pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it.\n",
      "it was a small cavity under ten feet of water but i think that i can warrant the pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that.\n",
      "one has suggested that if such a leach hole should be found its connection with the meadow if any existed might be proved by conveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole and then putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow which would catch some of the particles carried through by the current.\n",
      "while i was surveying the ice which was sixteen inches thick undulated under a slight wind like water.\n",
      "it is well known that a level cannot be used on ice.\n",
      "at one rod from the shore its greatest fluctuation when observed by means of a level on land directed toward a graduated staff on the ice was three quarters of an inch though the ice appeared firmly attached to the shore.\n",
      "it was probably greater in the middle.\n",
      "who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth.\n",
      "when two legs of my level were on the shore and the third on the ice and the sights were directed over the latter a rise or fall of the ice of an almost infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across the pond.\n",
      "when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three or four inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it thus far but the water began immediately to run into these holes and continued to run for two days in deep streams which wore away the ice on every side and contributed essentially if not mainly to dry the surface of the pond for as the water ran in it raised and floated the ice.\n",
      "this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out.\n",
      "when such holes freeze and a rain succeeds and finally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all it is beautifully mottled internally by dark figures shaped somewhat like a spiders web what you may call ice rosettes produced by the channels worn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre.\n",
      "sometimes also when the ice was covered with shallow puddles i saw a double shadow of myself one standing on the head of the other one on the ice the other on the trees or hill-side.\n",
      " while yet it is cold january and snow and ice are thick and solid the prudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer drink impressively even pathetically wise to foresee the heat and thirst of july now in january—wearing a thick coat and mittens when so many things are not provided for.\n",
      "it may be that he lays up no treasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next.\n",
      "he cuts and saws the solid pond unroofs the house of fishes and carts off their very element and air held fast by chains and stakes like corded wood through the favoring winter air to wintry cellars to underlie the summer there.\n",
      "it looks like solidified azure as far off it is drawn through the streets.\n",
      "these ice-cutters are a merry race full of jest and sport and when i went among them they were wont to invite me to saw pit-fashion with them i standing underneath.\n",
      "in the winter of 46–7 there came a hundred men of hyperborean extraction swoop down on to our pond one morning with many car-loads of ungainly-looking farming tools sleds ploughs drill-barrows turf-knives spades saws rakes and each man was armed with a double-pointed pike-staff such as is not described in the new-england farmer or the cultivator.\n",
      "i did not know whether they had come to sow a crop of winter rye or some other kind of grain recently introduced from iceland.\n",
      "as i saw no manure i judged that they meant to skim the land as i had done thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow long enough.\n",
      "they said that a gentleman farmer who was behind the scenes wanted to double his money which as i understood amounted to half a million already but in order to cover each one of his dollars with another he took off the only coat ay the skin itself of walden pond in the midst of a hard winter.\n",
      "they went to work at once ploughing harrowing rolling furrowing in admirable order as if they were bent on making this a model farm but when i was looking sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow a gang of fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself with a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the water—for it was a very springy soil—indeed all the terra firma there was—and haul it away on sleds and then i guessed that they must be cutting peat in a bog.\n",
      "so they came and went every day with a peculiar shriek from the locomotive from and to some point of the polar regions as it seemed to me like a flock of arctic snow-birds.\n",
      "but sometimes squaw walden had her revenge and a hired man walking behind his team slipped through a crack in the ground down toward tartarus and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man almost gave up his animal heat and was glad to take refuge in my house and acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove or sometimes the frozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare or a plough got set in the furrow and had to be cut out.\n",
      "to speak literally a hundred irishmen with yankee overseers came from cambridge every day to get out the ice.\n",
      "they divided it into cakes by methods too well known to require description and these being sledded to the shore were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform and raised by grappling irons and block and tackle worked by horses on to a stack as surely as so many barrels of flour and there placed evenly side by side and row upon row as if they formed the solid base of an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds.\n",
      "they told me that in a good day they could get out a thousand tons which was the yield of about one acre.\n",
      "deep ruts and cradle holes were worn in the ice as on terra firma by the passage of the sleds over the same track and the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets.\n",
      "they stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile thirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square putting hay between the outside layers to exclude the air for when the wind though never so cold finds a passage through it will wear large cavities leaving slight supports or studs only here and there and finally topple it down.\n",
      "at first it looked like a vast blue fort or valhalla but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the crevices and this became covered with rime and icicles it looked like a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin built of azure-tinted marble the abode of winter that old man we see in the almanac—his shanty as if he had a design to estivate with us.\n",
      "they calculated that not twenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination and that two or three per cent would be wasted in the cars.\n",
      "however a still greater part of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended for either because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected containing more air than usual or for some other reason it never got to market.\n",
      "this heap made in the winter of 46–7 and estimated to contain ten thousand tons was finally covered with hay and boards and though it was unroofed the following july and a part of it carried off the rest remaining exposed to the sun it stood over that summer and the next winter and was not quite melted till september 1848.\n",
      "thus the pond recovered the greater part.\n",
      "like the water the walden ice seen near at hand has a green tint but at a distance is beautifully blue and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the river or the merely greenish ice of some ponds a quarter of a mile off.\n",
      "sometimes one of those great cakes slips from the ice-mans sled into the village street and lies there for a week like a great emerald an object of interest to all passers.\n",
      "i have noticed that a portion of walden which in the state of water was green will often when frozen appear from the same point of view blue.\n",
      "so the hollows about this pond will sometimes in the winter be filled with a greenish water somewhat like its own but the next day will have frozen blue.\n",
      "perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and air they contain and the most transparent is the bluest.\n",
      "ice is an interesting subject for contemplation.\n",
      "they told me that they had some in the ice-houses at fresh pond five years old which was as good as ever.\n",
      "why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid but frozen remains sweet forever.\n",
      "it is commonly said that this is the difference between the affections and the intellect.\n",
      "thus for sixteen days i saw from my window a hundred men at work like busy husbandmen with teams and horses and apparently all the implements of farming such a picture as we see on the first page of the almanac and as often as i looked out i was reminded of the fable of the lark and the reapers or the parable of the sower and the like and now they are all gone and in thirty days more probably i shall look from the same window on the pure sea-green walden water there reflecting the clouds and the trees and sending up its evaporations in solitude and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood there.\n",
      "perhaps i shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes himself or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat like a floating leaf beholding his form reflected in the waves where lately a hundred men securely labored.\n",
      "thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of charleston and new orleans of madras and bombay and calcutta drink at my well.\n",
      "in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions.\n",
      "i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the bramin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug.\n",
      "i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well.\n",
      "the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges.\n",
      "with favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of atlantis and the hesperides makes the periplus of hanno and floating by ternate and tidore and the mouth of the persian gulf melts in the tropic gales of the indian seas and is landed in ports of which alexander only heard the names.\n",
      " spring the opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond to break up earlier for the water agitated by the wind even in cold weather wears away the surrounding ice.\n",
      "but such was not the effect on walden that year for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the place of the old.\n",
      "this pond never breaks up so soon as the others in this neighborhood on account both of its greater depth and its having no stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice.\n",
      "i never knew it to open in the course of a winter not excepting that of 52–3 which gave the ponds so severe a trial.\n",
      "it commonly opens about the first of april a week or ten days later than flints pond and fair-haven beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts where it began to freeze.\n",
      "it indicates better than any water hereabouts the absolute progress of the season being least affected by transient changes of temperature.\n",
      "a severe cold of a few days duration in march may very much retard the opening of the former ponds while the temperature of walden increases almost uninterruptedly.\n",
      "a thermometer thrust into the middle of walden on the 6th of march 1847 stood at 32° or freezing point near the shore at 33° in the middle of flints pond the same day at 32½° at a dozen rods from the shore in shallow water under ice a foot thick at 36°.\n",
      "this difference of three and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond and the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow show why it should break up so much sooner than walden.\n",
      "the ice in the shallowest part was at this time several inches thinner than in the middle.\n",
      "in mid-winter the middle had been the warmest and the ice thinnest there.\n",
      "so also every one who has waded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is close to the shore where only three or four inches deep than a little distance out and on the surface where it is deep than near the bottom.\n",
      "in spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the increased temperature of the air and earth but its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water and so also warms the water and melts the under side of the ice at the same time that it is melting it more directly above making it uneven and causing the air bubbles which it contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain.\n",
      "ice has its grain as well as wood and when a cake begins to rot or comb that is assume the appearance of honey-comb whatever may be its position the air cells are at right angles with what was the water surface.\n",
      "where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over it is much thinner and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat and i have been told that in the experiment at cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond though the cold air circulated underneath and so had access to both sides the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this advantage.\n",
      "when a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the snow-ice from walden and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice a rod or more wide about the shores created by this reflected heat.\n",
      "also as i have said the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.\n",
      "the phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small scale.\n",
      "every morning generally speaking the shallow water is being warmed more rapidly than the deep though it may not be made so warm after all and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the morning.\n",
      "the day is an epitome of the year.\n",
      "the night is the winter the morning and evening are the spring and fall and the noon is the summer.\n",
      "the cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature.\n",
      "one pleasant morning after a cold night february 24th 1850 having gone to flints pond to spend the day i noticed with surprise that when i struck the ice with the head of my axe it resounded like a gong for many rods around or as if i had struck on a tight drum-head.\n",
      "the pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise when it felt the influence of the suns rays slanted upon it from over the hills it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult which was kept up three or four hours.\n",
      "it took a short siesta at noon and boomed once more toward night as the sun was withdrawing his influence.\n",
      "in the right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great regularity.\n",
      "but in the middle of the day being full of cracks and the air also being less elastic it had completely lost its resonance and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it.\n",
      "the fishermen say that the thundering of the pond scares the fishes and prevents their biting.\n",
      "the pond does not thunder every evening and i cannot tell surely when to expect its thundering but though i may perceive no difference in the weather it does.\n",
      "who would have suspected so large and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive.\n",

      "on the 13th of march after i had heard the bluebird song-sparrow and red-wing the ice was still nearly a foot thick.\n",
      "as the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away by the water nor broken up and floated off as in rivers but though it was completely melted for half a rod in width about the shore the middle was merely honey-combed and saturated with water so that you could put your foot through it when six inches thick but by the next day evening perhaps after a warm rain followed by fog it would have wholly disappeared all gone off with the fog spirited away.\n",
      "one year i went across the middle only five days before it disappeared entirely.\n",

      "every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds and the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who live in a climate of so great extremes.\n",
      "when the warmer days come they who dwell near the river hear the ice crack at night with a startling whoop as loud as artillery as if its icy fetters were rent from end to end and within a few days see it rapidly going out.\n",
      "so the alligator comes out of the mud with quakings of the earth.\n",
      "one old man who has been a close observer of nature and seems as thoroughly wise in regard to all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks when he was a boy and he had helped to lay her keel—who has come to his growth and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should live to the age of methuselah—told me and i was surprised to hear him express wonder at any of natures operations for i thought that there were no secrets between them that one spring day he took his gun and boat and thought that he would have a little sport with the ducks.\n",
      "there was ice still on the meadows but it was all gone out of the river and he dropped down without obstruction from sudbury where he lived to fair-haven pond which he found unexpectedly covered for the most part with a firm field of ice.\n",
      "it was a warm day and he was surprised to see so great a body of ice remaining.\n",
      "not seeing any ducks he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in the pond and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side to await them.\n",
      "the ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore and there was a smooth and warm sheet of water with a muddy bottom such as the ducks love within and he thought it likely that some would be along pretty soon.\n",
      "after he had lain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound but singularly grand and impressive unlike any thing he had ever heard gradually swelling and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending a sullen rush and roar which seemed to him all at once like the sound of a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there and seizing his gun he started up in haste and excited but he found to his surprise that the whole body of the ice had started while he lay there and drifted in to the shore and the sound he had heard was made by its edge grating on the shore—at first gently nibbled and crumbled off but at length heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to a considerable height before it came to a stand still.\n",
      "at length the suns rays have attained the right angle and warm winds blow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks and the sun dispersing the mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking with incense through which the traveller picks his way from islet to islet cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing off.\n",
      "few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which thawing sand and clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on the railroad through which i passed on my way to the village a phenomenon not very common on so large a scale though the number of freshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatly multiplied since railroads were invented.\n",
      "the material was sand of every degree of fineness and of various rich colors commonly mixed with a little clay.\n",
      "when the frost comes out in the spring and even in a thawing day in the winter the sand begins to flow down the slopes like lava sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing it where no sand was to be seen before.\n",
      "innumerable little streams overlap and interlace one with another exhibiting a sort of hybrid product which obeys half way the law of currents and half way that of vegetation.\n",
      "as it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves or vines making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth and resembling as you look down on them the laciniated lobed and imbricated thalluses of some lichens or you are reminded of coral of leopards paws or birds feet of brains or lungs or bowels and excrements of all kinds.\n",
      "it is a truly grotesque vegetation whose forms and color we see imitated in bronze a sort of architectural foliage more ancient and typical than acanthus chiccory ivy vine or any vegetable leaves destined perhaps under some circumstances to become a puzzle to future geologists.\n",
      "the whole cut impressed me as if it were a cave with its stalactites laid open to the light.\n",
      "the various shades of the sand are singularly rich and agreeable embracing the different iron colors brown gray yellowish and reddish.\n",
      "when the flowing mass reaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into strands the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical form and gradually becoming more flat and broad running together as they are more moist till they form an almost flat sand still variously and beautifully shaded but in which you can trace the original forms of vegetation till at length in the water itself they are converted into banks like those formed off the mouths of rivers and the forms of vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom.\n",
      "the whole bank which is from twenty to forty feet high is sometimes overlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage or sandy rupture for a quarter of a mile on one or both sides the produce of one spring day.\n",
      "what makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existence thus suddenly.\n",
      "when i see on the one side the inert bank—for the sun acts on one side first—and on the other this luxuriant foliage the creation of an hour i am affected as if in a peculiar sense i stood in the laboratory of the artist who made the world and me—had come to where he was still at work sporting on this bank and with excess of energy strewing his fresh designs about.\n",
      "i feel as if i were nearer to the vitals of the globe for this sandy overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body.\n",
      "you find thus in the very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf.\n",
      "no wonder that the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves it so labors with the idea inwardly.\n",

      "you here see perchance how blood vessels are formed.\n",
      "if you look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point like the ball of the finger feeling its way slowly and blindly downward until at last with more heat and moisture as the sun gets higher the most fluid portion in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields separates from the latter and forms for itself a meandering channel or artery within that in which is seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or branches to another and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand.\n",
      "it is wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it flows using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges of its channel.\n",
      "such are the sources of rivers.\n",
      "in the silicious matter which the water deposits is perhaps the bony system and in the still finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue.\n",

      "when the ground was partially bare of snow and a few warm days had dried its surface somewhat it was pleasant to compare the first tender signs of the infant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty of the withered vegetation which had withstood the winter—life-everlasting golden-rods pinweeds and graceful wild grasses more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer even as if their beauty was not ripe till then even cotton-grass cat-tails mulleins johnswort hard-hack meadow-sweet and other strong stemmed plants those unexhausted granaries which entertain the earliest birds—decent weeds at least which widowed nature wears.\n",
      "i am particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the wool-grass it brings back the summer to our winter memories and is among the forms which art loves to copy and which in the vegetable kingdom have the same relation to types already in the mind of man that astronomy has.\n",

      "at the approach of spring the red-squirrels got under my house two at a time directly under my feet as i sat reading or writing and kept up the queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and gurgling sounds that ever were heard and when i stamped they only chirruped the louder as if past all fear and respect in their mad pranks defying humanity to stop them.\n",
      "no you dont—chickaree—chickaree.\n",
      "they were wholly deaf to my arguments or failed to perceive their force and fell into a strain of invective that was irresistible.\n",
      "the first sparrow of spring the year beginning with younger hope than ever the faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the blue-bird the song-sparrow and the red-wing as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell what at such a time are histories chronologies traditions and all written revelations.\n",

      "the grass flames up on the hillsides like a spring fire—et primitus oritur herba imbribus primoribus evocata—as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet the returning sun not yellow but green is the color of its flame—the symbol of perpetual youth the grass-blade like a long green ribbon streams from the sod into the summer checked indeed by the frost but anon pushing on again lifting its spear of last years hay with the fresh life below.\n",
      "it grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground.\n",
      "it is almost identical with that for in the growing days of june when the rills are dry the grass blades are their channels and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream and the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply.\n",
      "so our human life but dies down to its root and still puts forth its green blade to eternity.\n",
      "walden is melting apace.\n",
      "there is a canal two rods wide along the northerly and westerly sides and wider still at the east end.\n",
      "a great field of ice has cracked off from the main body.\n",

      "he too is helping to crack it.\n",
      "how handsome the great sweeping curves in the edge of the ice answering somewhat to those of the shore but more regular it is unusually hard owing to the recent severe but transient cold and all watered or waved like a palace floor.\n",
      "but the wind slides eastward over its opaque surface in vain till it reaches the living surface beyond.\n",
      "it is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling in the sun the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth as if it spoke the joy of the fishes within it and of the sands on its shore—a silvery sheen as from the scales of a leuciscus as it were all one active fish.\n",
      "such is the contrast between winter and spring.\n",
      "walden was dead and is alive again.\n",
      "but this spring it broke up more steadily as i have said.\n",
      "the change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather from dark and sluggish hours to bright and elastic ones is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim.\n",
      "it is seemingly instantaneous at last.\n",
      "suddenly an influx of light filled my house though the evening was at hand and the clouds of winter still overhung it and the eaves were dripping with sleety rain.\n",
      "i looked out the window and lo where yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom though none was visible overhead as if it had intelligence with some remote horizon.\n",
      "i heard a robin in the distance the first i had heard for many a thousand years methought whose note i shall not forget for many a thousand more—the same sweet and powerful song as of yore.\n",

      "this at least is not the turdus migratorius.\n",
      "the pitch-pines and shrub-oaks about my house which had so long drooped suddenly resumed their several characters looked brighter greener and more erect and alive as if effectually cleansed and restored by the rain.\n",
      "i knew that it would not rain any more.\n",
      "you may tell by looking at any twig of the forest ay at your very wood-pile whether its winter is past or not.\n",
      "as it grew darker i was startled by the honking of geese flying low over the woods like weary travellers getting in late from southern lakes and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation.\n",
      "standing at my door i could hear the rush of their wings when driving toward my house they suddenly spied my light and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in the pond.\n",
      "so i came in and shut the door and passed my first spring night in the woods.\n",
      "in the morning i watched the geese from the door through the mist sailing in the middle of the pond fifty rods off so large and tumultuous that walden appeared like an artificial pond for their amusement.\n",
      "but when i stood on the shore they at once rose up with a great flapping of wings at the signal of their commander and when they had got into rank circled about over my head twenty-nine of them and then steered straight to canada with a regular honk from the leader at intervals trusting to break their fast in muddier pools.\n",
      "a plump of ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in the wake of their noisier cousins.\n",
      "for a week i heard the circling groping clangor of some solitary goose in the foggy mornings seeking its companion and still peopling the woods with the sound of a larger life than they could sustain.\n",
      "in april the pigeons were seen again flying express in small flocks and in due time i heard the martins twittering over my clearing though it had not seemed that the township contained so many that it could afford me any and i fancied that they were peculiarly of the ancient race that dwelt in hollow trees ere white men came.\n",
      "in almost all climes the tortoise and the frog are among the precursors and heralds of this season and birds fly with song and glancing plumage and plants spring and bloom and winds blow to correct this slight oscillation of the poles and preserve the equilibrium of nature.\n",
      "as every season seems best to us in its turn so the coming in of spring is like the creation of cosmos out of chaos and the realization of the golden age.\n",

      "so our prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts.\n",

      "you may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief a drunkard or a sensualist and merely pitied or despised him and despaired of the world but the sun shines bright and warm this first spring morning re-creating the world and you meet him at some serene work and see how his exhausted and debauched veins expand with still joy and bless the new day feel the spring influence with the innocence of infancy and all his faults are forgotten.\n",
      "there is not only an atmosphere of good will about him but even a savor of holiness groping for expression blindly and ineffectually perhaps like a new-born instinct and for a short hour the south hill-side echoes to no vulgar jest.\n",

      "a return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficent breath of the morning causes that in respect to the love of virtue and the hatred of vice one approaches a little the primitive nature of man as the sprouts of the forest which has been felled.\n",
      "in like manner the evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents the germs of virtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves and destroys them.\n",
      "after the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times from developing themselves then the beneficent breath of evening does not suffice to preserve them.\n",
      "as soon as the breath of evening does not suffice longer to preserve them then the nature of man does not differ much from that of the brute.\n",
      "men seeing the nature of this man like that of the brute think that he has never possessed the innate faculty of reason.\n",

      " on the 29th of april as i was fishing from the bank of the river near the nine-acre-corner bridge standing on the quaking grass and willow roots where the muskrats lurk i heard a singular rattling sound somewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingers when looking up i observed a very slight and graceful hawk like a night-hawk alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod or two over and over showing the underside of its wings which gleamed like a satin ribbon in the sun or like the pearly inside of a shell.\n",
      "this sight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry are associated with that sport.\n",
      "the merlin it seemed to me it might be called but i care not for its name.\n",
      "it was the most ethereal flight i had ever witnessed.\n",
      "it did not simply flutter like a butterfly nor soar like the larger hawks but it sported with proud reliance in the fields of air mounting again and again with its strange chuckle it repeated its free and beautiful fall turning over and over like a kite and then recovering from its lofty tumbling as if it had never set its foot on terra firma.\n",
      "it appeared to have no companion in the universe—sporting there alone—and to need none but the morning and the ether with which it played.\n",
      "it was not lonely but made all the earth lonely beneath it.\n",
      "where was the parent which hatched it its kindred and its father in the heavens.\n",
      "the tenant of the air it seemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time in the crevice of a crag—or was its native nest made in the angle of a cloud woven of the rainbows trimmings and the sunset sky and lined with some soft midsummer haze caught up from earth.\n",
      "its eyry now some cliffy cloud.\n",
      "beside this i got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous fishes which looked like a string of jewels.\n",
      "ah i have penetrated to those meadows on the morning of many a first spring day jumping from hummock to hummock from willow root to willow root when the wild river valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead if they had been slumbering in their graves as some suppose.\n",

      "our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and meadows which surround it.\n",
      "we need the tonic of wildness—to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk and hear the booming of the snipe to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground.\n",
      "at the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable that land and sea be infinitely wild unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable.\n",
      "we can never have enough of nature.\n",

      "we are cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast.\n",
      "there was a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house which compelled me sometimes to go out of my way especially in the night when the air was heavy but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and inviolable health of nature was my compensation for this.\n",

      "i wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way.\n",
      "i saw that if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as i was.\n",
      "i did nor for a moment feel confined and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar.\n",
      "i felt as if i alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax.\n",
      "they plainly did not know how to treat me but behaved like persons who are underbred.\n",
      "in every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall.\n",
      "i could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations which followed them out again without let or hindrance and they were really all that was dangerous.\n",
      "as they could not reach me they had resolved to punish my body just as boys if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite will abuse his dog.\n",
      "i saw that the state was half-witted that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons and that it did not know its friends from its foes and i lost all my remaining respect for it and pitied it.\n",
      "thus the state never intentionally confronts a mans sense intellectual or moral but only his body his senses.\n",
      "it is not armed with superior wit or honesty but with superior physical strength.\n",
      "i was not born to be forced.\n",
      "i will breathe after my own fashion.\n",
      "let us see who is the strongest.\n",
      "what force has a multitude.\n",
      "they only can force me who obey a higher law than i.\n",
      "they force me to become like themselves.\n",
      "i do not hear of men being forced to live this way or that by masses of men.\n",
      "what sort of life were that to live.\n",
      "when i meet a government which says to me your money or your life why should i be in haste to give it my money.\n",
      "it may be in a great strait and not know what to do i cannot help that.\n",
      "it must help itself do as i do.\n",
      "it is not worth the while to snivel about it.\n",
      "i am not responsible for the successful working of the machinery of society.\n",
      "i am not the son of the engineer.\n",
      "i perceive that when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side the one does not remain inert to make way for the other but both obey their own laws and spring and grow and flourish as best they can till one perchance overshadows and destroys the other.\n",
      "if a plant cannot live according to its nature it dies and so a man.\n",
      " the night in prison was novel and interesting enough.\n",
      "the prisoners in their shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the door-way when i entered.\n",
      "but the jailer said come boys it is time to lock up and so they dispersed and i heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments.\n",
      "my room-mate was introduced to me by the jailer as a first-rate fellow and a clever man.\n",
      " when the door was locked he showed me where to hang my hat and how he managed matters there.\n",
      "the rooms were whitewashed once a month and this one at least was the whitest most simply furnished and probably the neatest apartment in town.\n",
      "he naturally wanted to know where i came from and what brought me there and when i had told him i asked him in my turn how he came there presuming him to be an honest man of course and as the world goes i believe he was.\n",
      "why said he they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it.\n",
      " as near as i could discover he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smoked his pipe there and so a barn was burnt.\n",
      "he had the reputation of being a clever man had been there some three months waiting for his trial to come on and would have to wait as much longer but he was quite domesticated and contented since he got his board for nothing and thought that he was well treated.\n",
      "he occupied one window and i the other and i saw that if one stayed there long his principal business would be to look out the window.\n",
      "i had soon read all the tracts that were left there and examined where former prisoners had broken out and where a grate had been sawed off and heard the history of the various occupants of that room for i found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail.\n",
      "probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed which are afterward printed in a circular form but not published.\n",
      "i was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape who avenged themselves by singing them.\n",
      "i pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as i could for fear i should never see him again but at length he showed me which was my bed and left me to blow out the lamp.\n",
      "it was like travelling into a far country such as i had never expected to behold to lie there for one night.\n",
      "it seemed to me that i never had heard the town-clock strike before nor the evening sounds of the village for we slept with the windows open which were inside the grating.\n",
      "it was to see my native village in the light of the middle ages and our concord was turned into a rhine stream and visions of knights and castles passed before me.\n",
      "they were the voices of old burghers that i heard in the streets.\n",
      "i was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the adjacent village-inn—a wholly new and rare experience to me.\n",
      "it was a closer view of my native town.\n",
      "i was fairly inside of it.\n",
      "i never had seen its institutions before.\n",
      "this is one of its peculiar institutions for it is a shire town.\n",
      "i began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about.\n",
      "in the morning our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door in small oblong-square tin pans made to fit and holding a pint of chocolate with brown bread and an iron spoon.\n",
      "when they called for the vessels again i was green enough to return what bread i had left but my comrade seized it and said that i should lay that up for lunch or dinner.\n",
      "soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field whither he went every day and would not be back till noon so he bade me good-day saying that he doubted if he should see me again.\n",
      "when i came out of prison—for some one interfered and paid the tax—i did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged a gray-headed man and yet a change had to my eyes come over the scene—the town and state and country—greater than any that mere time could effect.\n",
      "i saw yet more distinctly the state in which i lived.\n",
      "i saw to what extent the people among whom i lived could be trusted as good neighbors and friends that their friendship was for summer weather only that they did not greatly purpose to do right that they were a distinct race from me by their prejudices and superstitions as the chinamen and malays are that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks not even to their property that after all they were not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them and hoped by a certain outward observance and a few prayers and by walking in a particular straight though useless path from time to time to save their souls.\n",
      "this may be to judge my neighbors harshly for i believe that most of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in their village.\n",
      "it was formerly the custom in our village when a poor debtor came out of jail for his acquaintances to salute him looking through their fingers which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window how do ye do.\n",
      " my neighbors did not thus salute me but first looked at me and then at one another as if i had returned from a long journey.\n",
      "i was put into jail as i was going to the shoemakers to get a shoe which was mended.\n",
      "when i was let out the next morning i proceeded to finish my errand and having put on my mended shoe joined a huckleberry party who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct and in half an hour—for the horse was soon tackled—was in the midst of a huckleberry field on one of our highest hills two miles off and then the state was nowhere to be seen.\n",
      "this is the whole history of my prisons.\n",
      "  i have never declined paying the highway tax because i am as desirous of being a good neighbor as i am of being a bad subject and as for supporting schools i am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen now.\n",
      "it is for no particular item in the tax-bill that i refuse to pay it.\n",
      "i simply wish to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually.\n",
      "i do not care to trace the course of my dollar if i could till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one with—the dollar is innocent—but i am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance.\n",
      "in fact i quietly declare war with the state after my fashion though i will still make use and get what advantages of her i can as is usual in such cases.\n",
      "if others pay the tax which is demanded of me from a sympathy with the state they do but what they have already done in their own case or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the state requires.\n",
      "if they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed to save his property or prevent his going to jail it is because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with the public good.\n",
      "this then is my position at present.\n",
      "but one cannot be too much on his guard in such a case lest his actions be biassed by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions of men.\n",
      "let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour.\n",
      "i think sometimes why this people mean well they are only ignorant they would do better if they knew how why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to.\n",
      "but i think again this is no reason why i should do as they do or permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind.\n",
      "again i sometimes say to myself when many millions of men without heat without ill-will without personal feeling of any kind demand of you a few shillings only without the possibility such is their constitution of retracting or altering their present demand and without the possibility on your side of appeal to any other millions why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force.\n",
      "you do not resist cold and hunger the winds and the waves thus obstinately you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities.\n",
      "you do not put your head into the fire.\n",
      "but just in proportion as i regard this as not wholly a brute force but partly a human force and consider that i have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men and not of mere brute or inanimate things i see that appeal is possible first and instantaneously from them to the maker of them and secondly from them to themselves.\n",
      "but if i put my head deliberately into the fire there is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have only myself to blame.\n",
      "if i could convince myself that i have any right to be satisfied with men as they are and to treat them accordingly and not according in some respects to my requisitions and expectations of what they and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalist i should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are and say it is the will of god.\n",
      "and above all there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute or natural force that i can resist this with some effect but i cannot expect like orpheus to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts.\n",
      "i do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation.\n",
      "i do not wish to split hairs to make fine distinctions or set myself up as better than my neighbors.\n",
      "i seek rather i may say even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land.\n",
      "i am but too ready to conform to them.\n",
      "indeed i have reason to suspect myself on this head and each year as the tax-gatherer comes round i find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the general and state governments and the spirit of the people to discover a pretext for conformity.\n",
      "     we must affect our country as our parents      and if at any time we alienate      out love of industry from doing it honor      we must respect effects and teach the soul      matter of conscience and religion      and not desire of rule or benefit.\n",
      " i believe that the state will soon be able to take all my work of this sort out of my hands and then i shall be no better patriot than my fellow-countrymen.\n",
      "seen from a lower point of view the constitution with all its faults is very good the law and the courts are very respectable even this state and this american government are in many respects very admirable and rare things to be thankful for such as a great many have described them seen from a higher still and the highest who shall say what they are or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all.\n",
      "however the government does not concern me much and i shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it.\n",
      "it is not many moments that i live under a government even in this world.\n",
      "if a man is thought-free fancy-free imagination-free that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him.\n",
      "i know that most men think differently from myself but those whose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects content me as little as any.\n",
      "statesmen and legislators standing so completely within the institution never distinctly and nakedly behold it.\n",
      "they speak of moving society but have no resting-place without it.\n",
      "they may be men of a certain experience and discrimination and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems for which we sincerely thank them but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits.\n",
      "they are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency.\n",
      "webster never goes behind government and so cannot speak with authority about it.\n",
      "his words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government but for thinkers and those who legislate for all time he never once glances at the subject.\n",
      "i know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of his minds range and hospitality.\n",
      "yet compared with the cheap professions of most reformers and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general his are almost the only sensible and valuable words and we thank heaven for him.\n",
      "comparatively he is always strong original and above all practical.\n",
      "still his quality is not wisdom but prudence.\n",
      "the lawyers truth is not truth but consistency or a consistent expediency.\n",
      "truth is always in harmony with herself and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that may consist with wrong-doing.\n",
      "he well deserves to be called as he has been called the defender of the constitution.\n",
      "there are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones.\n",
      "he is not a leader but a follower.\n",
      "his leaders are the men of 87.\n",
      "i have never made an effort he says and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which the various states came into the union.\n",
      " still thinking of the sanction which the constitution gives to slavery he says because it was part of the original compact—let it stand.\n",
      " notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political relations and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellect—what for instance it behoves a man to do here in america today with regard to slavery but ventures or is driven to make some such desperate answer as the following while professing to speak absolutely and as a private man—from which what new and singular code of social duties might be inferred.\n",
      "—the manner says he in which the governments of those states where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration under the responsibility to their constituents to the general laws of propriety humanity and justice and to god.\n",
      "associations formed elsewhere springing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever to do with it.\n",
      "they have never received any encouragement from me and they never will.\n",
      " they who know of no purer sources of truth who have traced up its stream no higher stand and wisely stand by the bible and the constitution and drink at it there with reverence and humanity but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool gird up their loins once more and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountain-head.\n",
      "no man with a genius for legislation has appeared in america.\n",
      "they are rare in the history of the world.\n",
      "there are orators politicians and eloquent men by the thousand but the speaker has not yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of settling the much-vexed questions of the day.\n",
      "we love eloquence for its own sake and not for any truth which it may utter or any heroism it may inspire.\n",
      "our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom of union and of rectitude to a nation.\n",
      "they have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance commerce and manufactures and agriculture.\n",
      "if we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in congress for our guidance uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people america would not long retain her rank among the nations.\n",
      "for eighteen hundred years though perchance i have no right to say it the new testament has been written yet where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it sheds on the science of legislation.\n",
      "the authority of government even such as i am willing to submit to—for i will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than i and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well—is still an impure one to be strictly just it must have the sanction and consent of the governed.\n",
      "it can have no pure right over my person and property but what i concede to it.\n",
      "the progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy from a limited monarchy to a democracy is a progress toward a true respect for the individual.\n",
      "even the chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire.\n",
      "is a democracy such as we know it the last improvement possible in government.\n",
      "is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man.\n",
      "there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its own power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly.\n",
      "i please myself with imagining a state at last which can afford to be just to all men and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor which even would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from it not meddling with it nor embraced by it who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and fellow-men.\n",
      "a state which bore this kind of fruit and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious state which also i have imagined but not yet anywhere seen.\n",

      "i also dreamed that i might gather the wild herbs or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods even to the city by hay-cart loads PERIOD\n",
      "but i have since learned that trade curses everything it handles and though you trade in messages from heaven the whole curse of trade attaches to the business PERIOD\n",
      "as i preferred some things to others and especially valued my freedom as i could fare hard and yet succeed well i did not wish to spend my time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture or delicate cookery or a house in the grecian or the gothic style just yet PERIOD\n",

      "undoubtedly in this case what is true for one is truer still for a thousand as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one since one roof may cover one cellar underlie and one wall separate several apartments PERIOD\n",
      "but for my part i preferred the solitary dwelling PERIOD\n",
      "moreover it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall and when you have done this the common partition to be much cheaper must be a thin one and that other may prove a bad neighbor and also not keep his side in repair PERIOD\n",

      "at doing something—i will not engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good—i do not hesitate to say that i should be a capital fellow to hire but what that is it is for my employer to find out PERIOD\n",

      "it was on the whole a rare amusement which continued too long might have become a dissipation PERIOD\n",
      "though i gave them no manure and did not hoe them all once i hoed them unusually well as far as i went and was paid for it in the end there being in truth as evelyn says no compost or lætation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion repastination and turning of the mould with the spade PERIOD\n",

      "every day or two i strolled to the village to hear some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there circulating either from mouth to mouth or from newspaper to newspaper and which taken in homœopathic doses was really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs PERIOD\n",

      "in one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men as curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs each sitting at the mouth of its burrow or running over to a neighbors to gossip PERIOD\n",
      "i went there frequently to observe their habits PERIOD\n",
      "the village appeared to me a great news room and on one side to support it as once at redding & companys on state street they kept nuts and raisins or salt and meal and other groceries PERIOD\n",
      "some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity that is the news and such sound digestive organs that they can sit forever in public avenues without stirring and let it simmer and whisper through them like the etesian winds or as if inhaling ether it only producing numbness and insensibility to pain—otherwise it would often be painful to hear—without affecting the consciousness PERIOD\n",
      "i hardly ever failed when i rambled through the village to see a row of such worthies either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that from time to time with a voluptuous expression or else leaning against a barn with their hands in their pockets like caryatides as if to prop it up PERIOD\n",

      "these are the coarsest mills in which all gossip is first rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more delicate hoppers within doors PERIOD\n",
      "i observed that the vitals of the village were the grocery the bar-room the post-office and the bank and as a necessary part of the machinery they kept a bell a big gun and a fire-engine at convenient places and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of mankind in lanes and fronting one another so that every traveller had to run the gantlet and every man woman and child might get a lick at him PERIOD\n",
      "of course those who were stationed nearest to the head of the line where they could most see and be seen and have the first blow at him paid the highest prices for their places and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts where long gaps in the line began to occur and the traveller could get over walls or turn aside into cow paths and so escape paid a very slight ground or window tax PERIOD\n",
      "signs were hung out on all sides to allure him some to catch him by the appetite as the tavern and victualling cellar some by the fancy as the dry goods store and the jewellers and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts as the barber the shoemaker or the tailor PERIOD\n",
      "besides there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one of these houses and company expected about these times PERIOD\n",
      "for the most part i escaped wonderfully from these dangers either by proceeding at once boldly and without deliberation to the goal as is recommended to those who run the gantlet or by keeping my thoughts on high things like orpheus who loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre drowned the voices of the sirens and kept out of danger PERIOD\n",
      " sometimes i bolted suddenly and nobody could tell my whereabouts for i did not stand much about gracefulness and never hesitated at a gap in a fence PERIOD\n",
      "i was even accustomed to make an irruption into some houses where i was well entertained and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful of news what had subsided the prospects of war and peace and whether the world was likely to hold together much longer i was let out through the rear avenues and so escaped to the woods again PERIOD\n",
      "it was very pleasant when i stayed late in town to launch myself into the night especially if it was dark and tempestuous and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room with a bag of rye or indian meal upon my shoulder for my snug harbor in the woods having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts leaving only my outer man at the helm or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing PERIOD\n",

      "i frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route and where there was no cart-path to feel with my feet the faint track which i had worn or steer by the known relation of particular trees which i felt with my hands passing between two pines for instance not more than eighteen inches apart in the midst of the woods invariably in the darkest night PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes after coming home thus late in a dark and muggy night when my feet felt the path which my eyes could not see dreaming and absent-minded all the way until i was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch i have not been able to recall a single step of my walk and i have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake it as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance PERIOD\n",
      "several times when a visitor chanced to stay into evening and it proved a dark night i was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear of the house and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his eyes PERIOD\n",
      "one very dark night i directed thus on their way two young men who had been fishing in the pond PERIOD\n",
      "they lived about a mile off through the woods and were quite used to the route PERIOD\n",
      "a day or two after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night close by their own premises and did not get home till toward morning by which time as there had been several heavy showers in the mean while and the leaves were very wet they were drenched to their skins PERIOD\n",
      "i have heard of many going astray even in the village streets when the darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife as the saying is PERIOD\n",
      "some who live in the outskirts having come to town a-shopping in their wagons have been obliged to put up for the night and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way feeling the sidewalk only with their feet and not knowing when they turned PERIOD\n",

      "by night of course the perplexity is infinitely greater PERIOD\n",
      "in our most trivial walks we are constantly though unconsciously steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape and not till we are completely lost or turned round—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lost—do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature PERIOD\n",
      "every man has to learn the points of compass again as often as he awakes whether from sleep or any abstraction PERIOD\n",
      "not till we are lost in other words not till we have lost the world do we begin to find ourselves and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations PERIOD\n",
      "one afternoon near the end of the first summer when i went to the village to get a shoe from the cobblers i was seized and put into jail because as i have elsewhere related i did not pay a tax to or recognize the authority of the state which buys and sells men women and children like cattle at the door of its senate-house PERIOD\n",
      "i had gone down to the woods for other purposes PERIOD\n",
      "but wherever a man goes men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions and if they can constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society PERIOD\n",

      "occasionally after my hoeing was done for the day i joined some impatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning as silent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf and after practising various kinds of philosophy had concluded commonly by the time i arrived that he belonged to the ancient sect of cœnobites PERIOD\n",
      "there was one older man an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds of woodcraft who was pleased to look upon my house as a building erected for the convenience of fishermen and i was equally pleased when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines PERIOD\n",
      "once in a while we sat together on the pond he at one end of the boat and i at the other but not many words passed between us for he had grown deaf in his later years but he occasionally hummed a psalm which harmonized well enough with my philosophy PERIOD\n",
      "our intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony far more pleasing to remember than if it had been carried on by speech PERIOD\n",
      "when as was commonly the case i had none to commune with i used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on the side of my boat filling the surrounding woods with circling and dilating sound stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts until i elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side PERIOD\n",
      "in warm evenings i frequently sat in the boat playing the flute and saw the perch which i seemed to have charmed hovering around me and the moon travelling over the ribbed bottom which was strewed with the wrecks of the forest PERIOD\n",
      "formerly i had come to this pond adventurously from time to time in dark summer nights with a companion and making a fire close to the waters edge which we thought attracted the fishes we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread and when we had done far in the night threw the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets which coming down into the pond were quenched with a loud hissing and we were suddenly groping in total darkness PERIOD\n",
      "through this whistling a tune we took our way to the haunts of men again PERIOD\n",
      "but now i had made my home by the shore PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes after staying in a village parlor till the family had all retired i have returned to the woods and partly with a view to the next days dinner spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight serenaded by owls and foxes and hearing from time to time the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand PERIOD\n",
      "these experiences were very memorable and valuable to me—anchored in forty feet of water and twenty or thirty rods from the shore surrounded sometimes by thousands of small perch and shiners dimpling the surface with their tails in the moonlight and communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as i drifted in the gentle night breeze now and then feeling a slight vibration along it indicative of some life prowling about its extremity of dull uncertain blundering purpose there and slow to make up its mind PERIOD\n",
      "at length you slowly raise pulling hand over hand some horned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air PERIOD\n",
      "it was very queer especially in dark nights when your thoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres to feel this faint jerk which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to nature again PERIOD\n",
      "it seemed as if i might next cast my line upward into the air as well as downward into this element which was scarcely more dense PERIOD\n",
      "thus i caught two fishes as it were with one hook PERIOD\n",
      " the scenery of walden is on a humble scale and though very beautiful does not approach to grandeur nor can it much concern one who has not long frequented it or lived by its shore yet this pond is so remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular description PERIOD\n",
      "it is a clear and deep green well half a mile long and a mile and three quarters in circumference and contains about sixty-one and a half acres a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak woods without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and evaporation PERIOD\n",
      "the surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the height of forty to eighty feet though on the south-east and east they attain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively within a quarter and a third of a mile PERIOD\n",
      "they are exclusively woodland PERIOD\n",
      "all our concord waters have two colors at least one when viewed at a distance and another more proper close at hand PERIOD\n",
      "the first depends more on the light and follows the sky PERIOD\n",
      "in clear weather in summer they appear blue at a little distance especially if agitated and at a great distance all appear alike PERIOD\n",
      "in stormy weather they are sometimes of a dark slate color PERIOD\n",
      "the sea however is said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere PERIOD\n",
      "i have seen our river when the landscape being covered with snow both water and ice were almost as green as grass PERIOD\n",
      "some consider blue to be the color of pure water whether liquid or solid PERIOD\n",
      " but looking directly down into our waters from a boat they are seen to be of very different colors PERIOD\n",
      "walden is blue at one time and green at another even from the same point of view PERIOD\n",
      "lying between the earth and the heavens it partakes of the color of both PERIOD\n",
      "viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand then a light green which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the pond PERIOD\n",
      "in some lights viewed even from a hill-top it is of a vivid green next the shore PERIOD\n",
      "some have referred this to the reflection of the verdure but it is equally green there against the railroad sand-bank and in the spring before the leaves are expanded and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand PERIOD\n",
      "such is the color of its iris PERIOD\n",
      "this is that portion also where in the spring the ice being warmed by the heat of the sun reflected from the bottom and also transmitted through the earth melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle PERIOD\n",
      "like the rest of our waters when much agitated in clear weather so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle or because there is more light mixed with it it appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself and at such a time being on its surface and looking with divided vision so as to see the reflection i have discerned a matchless and indescribable light blue such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest more cerulean than the sky itself alternating with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves which last appeared but muddy in comparison PERIOD\n",
      "it is a vitreous greenish blue as i remember it like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown PERIOD\n",
      "yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air PERIOD\n",
      "it is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint owing as the makers say to its body but a small piece of the same will be colorless PERIOD\n",
      "how large a body of walden water would be required to reflect a green tint i have never proved PERIOD\n",
      "the water of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it and like that of most ponds imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge but this water is of such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness still more unnatural which as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal produces a monstrous effect making fit studies for a michael angelo PERIOD\n",
      "the water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet PERIOD\n",
      "paddling over it you may see many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners perhaps only an inch long yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there PERIOD\n",
      "once in the winter many years ago when i had been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel as i stepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice but as if some evil genius had directed it it slid four or five rods directly into one of the holes where the water was twenty-five feet deep PERIOD\n",
      "out of curiosity i lay down on the ice and looked through the hole until i saw the axe a little on one side standing on its head with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off if i had not disturbed it PERIOD\n",
      "making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which i had and cutting down the longest birch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife i made a slip-noose which i attached to its end and letting it down carefully passed it over the knob of the handle and drew it by a line along the birch and so pulled the axe out again PERIOD\n",
      "the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving stones excepting one or two short sand beaches and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head and were it not for its remarkable transparency that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side PERIOD\n",
      "some think it is bottomless PERIOD\n",
      "it is nowhere muddy and a casual observer would say that there were no weeds at all in it and of noticeable plants except in the little meadows recently overflowed which do not properly belong to it a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush nor even a lily yellow or white but only a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons and perhaps a water-target or two all which however a bather might not perceive and these plants are clean and bright like the element they grow in PERIOD\n",
      "the stones extend a rod or two into the water and then the bottom is pure sand except in the deepest parts where there is usually a little sediment probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter PERIOD\n",
      "we have one other pond just like this white pond in nine acre corner about two and a half miles westerly but though i am acquainted with most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre i do not know a third of this pure and well-like character PERIOD\n",
      "successive nations perchance have drank at admired and fathomed it and passed away and still its water is green and pellucid as ever PERIOD\n",
      "not an intermitting spring perhaps on that spring morning when adam and eve were driven out of eden walden pond was already in existence and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind and covered with myriads of ducks and geese which had not heard of the fall when still such pure lakes sufficed them PERIOD\n",
      "even then it had commenced to rise and fall and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now wear and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only walden pond in the world and distiller of celestial dews PERIOD\n",
      "who knows in how many unremembered nations literatures this has been the castalian fountain PERIOD\n",
      "or what nymphs presided over it in the golden age PERIOD\n",
      "it is a gem of the first water which concord wears in her coronet PERIOD\n",
      "yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their footsteps PERIOD\n",
      "i have been surprised to detect encircling the pond even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore a narrow shelf-like path in the steep hill-side alternately rising and falling approaching and receding from the waters edge as old probably as the race of man here worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters and still from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land PERIOD\n",
      "this is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter just after a light snow has fallen appearing as a clear undulating white line unobscured by weeds and twigs and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable close at hand PERIOD\n",
      "the snow reprints it as it were in clear white type alto-relievo PERIOD\n",
      "the ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this PERIOD\n",
      "the pond rises and falls but whether regularly or not and within what period nobody knows though as usual many pretend to know PERIOD\n",
      "it is commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer though not corresponding to the general wet and dryness PERIOD\n",
      "i can remember when it was a foot or two lower and also when it was at least five feet higher than when i lived by it PERIOD\n",
      "there is a narrow sand-bar running into it with very deep water on one side on which i helped boil a kettle of chowder some six rods from the main shore about the year 1824 which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years and on the other hand my friends used to listen with incredulity when i told them that a few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods fifteen rods from the only shore they knew which place was long since converted into a meadow PERIOD\n",
      "but the pond has risen steadily for two years and now in the summer of 52 is just five feet higher than when i lived there or as high as it was thirty years ago and fishing goes on again in the meadow PERIOD\n",
      "this makes a difference of level at the outside of six or seven feet and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs PERIOD\n",
      "this same summer the pond has begun to fall again PERIOD\n",
      "it is remarkable that this fluctuation whether periodical or not appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment PERIOD\n",
      "i have observed one rise and a part of two falls and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as i have ever known it PERIOD\n",
      "flints pond a mile eastward allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets and the smaller intermediate ponds also sympathize with walden and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter PERIOD\n",
      "the same is true as far as my observation goes of white pond PERIOD\n",
      "this rise and fall of walden at long intervals serves this use at least the water standing at this great height for a year or more though it makes it difficult to walk round it kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise pitch-pines birches alders aspens and others and falling again leaves an unobstructed shore for unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest PERIOD\n",
      "on the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever and thus a stop put to their encroachments and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height PERIOD\n",
      "by this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore and thus the shore is shorn and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession PERIOD\n",
      "these are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows PERIOD\n",
      "it licks its chaps from time to time PERIOD\n",
      "when the water is at its height the alders willows and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water and to the height of three or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintain themselves and i have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shore which commonly produce no fruit bear an abundant crop under these circumstances PERIOD\n",
      "some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved PERIOD\n",
      "my townsmen have all heard the tradition the oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youth that anciently the indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth and they used much profanity as the story goes though this vice is one of which the indians were never guilty and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank and only one old squaw named walden escaped and from her the pond was named PERIOD\n",
      "it has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore PERIOD\n",
      "it is very certain at any rate that once there was no pond here and now there is one and this indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i have mentioned who remembers so well when he first came here with his divining rod saw a thin vapor rising from the sward and the hazel pointed steadily downward and he concluded to dig a well here PERIOD\n",
      "as for the stones many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills but i observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond and moreover there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt so that unfortunately it is no longer a mystery to me PERIOD\n",
      "i detect the paver PERIOD\n",
      "if the name was not derived from that of some english locality—saffron walden for instance—one might suppose that it was called originally walled-in pond PERIOD\n",
      "the pond was my well ready dug PERIOD\n",
      "for four months in the year its water is as cold as it is pure at all times and i think that it is then as good as any if not the best in the town PERIOD\n",
      "in the winter all water which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are protected from it PERIOD\n",
      "the temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room where i sat from five oclock in the afternoon till noon the next day the sixth of march 1846 the thermometer having been up to 65° or 70° some of the time owing partly to the sun on the roof was 42° or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn PERIOD\n",
      "the temperature of the boiling spring the same day was 45° or the warmest of any water tried though it is the coldest that i know of in summer when beside shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it PERIOD\n",
      "moreover in summer walden never becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun on account of its depth PERIOD\n",
      "in the warmest weather i usually placed a pailful in my cellar where it became cool in the night and remained so during the day though i also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood PERIOD\n",
      "it was as good when a week old as the day it was dipped and had no taste of the pump PERIOD\n",
      "whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond needs only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the luxury of ice PERIOD\n",
      "there have been caught in walden pickerel one weighing seven pounds to say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity which the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not see him perch and pouts some of each weighing over two pounds shiners chivins or roach leuciscus pulchellus a very few breams and a couple of eels one weighing four pounds—i am thus particular because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame and these are the only eels i have heard of here—also i have a faint recollection of a little fish some five inches long with silvery sides and a greenish back somewhat dace-like in its character which i mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable PERIOD\n",
      "nevertheless this pond is not very fertile in fish PERIOD\n",
      "its pickerel though not abundant are its chief boast PERIOD\n",
      "i have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds a long and shallow one steel-colored most like those caught in the river a bright golden kind with greenish reflections and remarkably deep which is the most common here and another golden-colored and shaped like the last but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones very much like a trout PERIOD\n",
      "the specific name reticulatus would not apply to this it should be guttatus rather PERIOD\n",
      "these are all very firm fish and weigh more than their size promises PERIOD\n",
      "the shiners pouts and perch also and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond are much cleaner handsomer and firmer fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds as the water is purer and they can easily be distinguished from them PERIOD\n",
      "probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them PERIOD\n",
      "there are also a clean race of frogs and tortoises and a few muscels in it muskrats and minks leave their traces about it and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes when i pushed off my boat in the morning i disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the night PERIOD\n",
      "ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall the white-bellied swallows hirundo bicolor skim over it and the peetweets totanus macularius teter along its stony shores all summer PERIOD\n",
      "i have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a white-pine over the water but i doubt if it is ever profaned by the wing of a gull like fair haven PERIOD\n",
      "at most it tolerates one annual loon PERIOD\n",
      "these are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now PERIOD\n",
      "you may see from a boat in calm weather near the sandy eastern shore where the water is eight or ten feet deep and also in some other parts of the pond some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height consisting of small stones less than a hens egg in size where all around is bare sand PERIOD\n",
      "at first you wonder if the indians could have formed them on the ice for any purpose and so when the ice melted they sank to the bottom but they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that PERIOD\n",
      "they are similar to those found in rivers but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here i know not by what fish they could be made PERIOD\n",
      "perhaps they are the nests of the chivin PERIOD\n",
      "these lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom PERIOD\n",
      "the shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous PERIOD\n",
      "i have in my minds eye the western indented with deep bays the bolder northern and the beautifully scalloped southern shore where successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves between PERIOD\n",
      "the forest has never so good a setting nor is so distinctly beautiful as when seen from the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the waters edge for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best foreground in such a case but with its winding shore the most natural and agreeable boundary to it PERIOD\n",
      "there is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there as where the axe has cleared a part or a cultivated field abuts on it PERIOD\n",
      "the trees have ample room to expand on the water side and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that direction PERIOD\n",
      "there nature has woven a natural selvage and the eye rises by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest trees PERIOD\n",
      "there are few traces of mans hand to be seen PERIOD\n",
      "the water laves the shore as it did a thousand years ago PERIOD\n",
      "a lake is the landscapes most beautiful and expressive feature PERIOD\n",
      "it is earths eye looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature PERIOD\n",
      "the fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows PERIOD\n",
      "standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond in a calm september afternoon when a slight haze makes the opposite shore line indistinct i have seen whence came the expression the glassy surface of a lake PERIOD\n",
      " when you invert your head it looks like a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley and gleaming against the distant pine woods separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another PERIOD\n",
      "you would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills and that the swallows which skim over might perch on it PERIOD\n",
      "indeed they sometimes dive below this line as it were by mistake and are undeceived PERIOD\n",
      "as you look over the pond westward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well as the true sun for they are equally bright and if between the two you survey its surface critically it is literally as smooth as glass except where the skater insects at equal intervals scattered over its whole extent by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it or perchance a duck plumes itself or as i have said a swallow skims so low as to touch it PERIOD\n",
      "it may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air and there is one bright flash where it emerges and another where it strikes the water sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed or here and there perhaps is a thistle-down floating on its surface which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again PERIOD\n",
      "it is like molten glass cooled but not congealed and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in glass PERIOD\n",
      "you may often detect a yet smoother and darker water separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb boom of the water nymphs resting on it PERIOD\n",
      "from a hill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any part for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake PERIOD\n",
      "it is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is advertised—this piscine murder will out—and from my distant perch i distinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods in diameter PERIOD\n",
      "you can even detect a water-bug gyrinus ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a quarter of a mile off for they furrow the water slightly making a conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines but the skaters glide over it without rippling it perceptibly PERIOD\n",
      "when the surface is considerably agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it but apparently in calm days they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it PERIOD\n",
      "it is a soothing employment on one of those fine days in the fall when all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated to sit on a stump on such a height as this overlooking the pond and study the dimpling circles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected skies and trees PERIOD\n",
      "over this great expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and assuaged as when a vase of water is jarred the trembling circles seek the shore and all is smooth again PERIOD\n",
      "not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples in lines of beauty as it were the constant welling up of its fountain the gentle pulsing of its life the heaving of its breast PERIOD\n",
      "the thrills of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable PERIOD\n",
      "how peaceful the phenomena of the lake again the works of man shine as in the spring PERIOD\n",
      "ay every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now at mid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning PERIOD\n",
      "every motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light and if an oar falls how sweet the echo in such a day in september or october walden is a perfect forest mirror set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or rarer PERIOD\n",
      "nothing so fair so pure and at the same time so large as a lake perchance lies on the surface of the earth PERIOD\n",
      "sky water PERIOD\n",
      "it needs no fence PERIOD\n",
      "nations come and go without defiling it PERIOD\n",
      "it is a mirror which no stone can crack whose quicksilver will never wear off whose gilding nature continually repairs no storms no dust can dim its surface ever fresh—a mirror in which all impurity presented to it sinks swept and dusted by the suns hazy brush—this the light dust-cloth—which retains no breath that is breathed on it but sends its own to float as clouds high above its surface and be reflected in its bosom still PERIOD\n",
      "a field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air PERIOD\n",
      "it is continually receiving new life and motion from above PERIOD\n",
      "it is intermediate in its nature between land and sky PERIOD\n",
      "on land only the grass and trees wave but the water itself is rippled by the wind PERIOD\n",
      "i see where the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light PERIOD\n",
      "it is remarkable that we can look down on its surface PERIOD\n",
      "we shall perhaps look down thus on the surface of air at length and mark where a still subtler spirit sweeps over it PERIOD\n",
      "the skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of october when the severe frosts have come and then and in november usually in a calm day there is absolutely nothing to ripple the surface PERIOD\n",
      "one november afternoon in the calm at the end of a rain storm of several days duration when the sky was still completely overcast and the air was full of mist i observed that the pond was remarkably smooth so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface though it no longer reflected the bright tints of october but the sombre november colors of the surrounding hills PERIOD\n",
      "though i passed over it as gently as possible the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost as far as i could see and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections PERIOD\n",
      "but as i was looking over the surface i saw here and there at a distance a faint glimmer as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be collected there or perchance the surface being so smooth betrayed where a spring welled up from the bottom PERIOD\n",
      "paddling gently to one of these places i was surprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch about five inches long of a rich bronze color in the green water sporting there and constantly rising to the surface and dimpling it sometimes leaving bubbles on it PERIOD\n",
      "in such transparent and seemingly bottomless water reflecting the clouds i seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon and their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering as if they were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left their fins like sails set all around them PERIOD\n",
      "there were many such schools in the pond apparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze struck it or a few rain-drops fell there PERIOD\n",
      "when i approached carelessly and alarmed them they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough and instantly took refuge in the depths PERIOD\n",
      "at length the wind rose the mist increased and the waves began to run and the perch leaped much higher than before half out of water a hundred black points three inches long at once above the surface PERIOD\n",
      "even as late as the fifth of december one year i saw some dimples on the surface and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately the air being full of mist i made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward already the rain seemed rapidly increasing though i felt none on my cheek and i anticipated a thorough soaking PERIOD\n",
      "but suddenly the dimples ceased for they were produced by the perch which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths and i saw their schools dimly disappearing so i spent a dry afternoon after all PERIOD\n",
      "an old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago when it was dark with surrounding forests tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water fowl and that there were many eagles about it PERIOD\n",
      "he came here a-fishing and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore PERIOD\n",
      "it was made of two white-pine logs dug out and pinned together and was cut off square at the ends PERIOD\n",
      "it was very clumsy but lasted a great many years before it became water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom PERIOD\n",
      "he did not know whose it was it belonged to the pond PERIOD\n",
      "he used to make a cable for his anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together PERIOD\n",
      "an old man a potter who lived by the pond before the revolution told him once that there was an iron chest at the bottom and that he had seen it PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes it would come floating up to the shore but when you went toward it it would go back into deep water and disappear PERIOD\n",
      "i was pleased to hear of the old log canoe which took the place of an indian one of the same material but more graceful construction which perchance had first been a tree on the bank and then as it were fell into the water to float there for a generation the most proper vessel for the lake PERIOD\n",
      "i remember that when i first looked into these depths there were many large trunks to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom which had either been blown over formerly or left on the ice at the last cutting when wood was cheaper but now they have mostly disappeared PERIOD\n",
      "when i first paddled a boat on walden it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty pine and oak woods and in some of its coves grape vines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under which a boat could pass PERIOD\n",
      "the hills which form its shores are so steep and the woods on them were then so high that as you looked down from the west end it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind of sylvan spectacle PERIOD\n",
      "i have spent many an hour when i was younger floating over its surface as the zephyr willed having paddled my boat to the middle and lying on my back across the seats in a summer forenoon dreaming awake until i was aroused by the boat touching the sand and i arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to days when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry PERIOD\n",
      "many a forenoon have i stolen away preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day for i was rich if not in money in sunny hours and summer days and spent them lavishly nor do i regret that i did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teachers desk PERIOD\n",
      "but since i left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood with occasional vistas through which you see the water PERIOD\n",
      "my muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth PERIOD\n",
      "how can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down PERIOD\n",
      "now the trunks of trees on the bottom and the old log canoe and the dark surrounding woods are gone and the villagers who scarcely know where it lies instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink are thinking to bring its water which should be as sacred as the ganges at least to the village in a pipe to wash their dishes with—to earn their walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug that devilish iron horse whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town has muddied the boiling spring with his foot and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on walden shore that trojan horse with a thousand men in his belly introduced by mercenary greeks where is the countrys champion the moore of moore hill to meet him at the deep cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated pest PERIOD\n",
      "nevertheless of all the characters i have known perhaps walden wears best and best preserves its purity PERIOD\n",
      "many men have been likened to it but few deserve that honor PERIOD\n",
      "though the woodchoppers have laid bare first this shore and then that and the irish have built their sties by it and the railroad has infringed on its border and the ice-men have skimmed it once it is itself unchanged the same water which my youthful eyes fell on all the change is in me PERIOD\n",
      "it has not acquired one permanent wrinkle after all its ripples PERIOD\n",
      "it is perennially young and i may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its surface as of yore PERIOD\n",
      "it struck me again tonight as if i had not seen it almost daily for more than twenty years—why here is walden the same woodland lake that i discovered so many years ago where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then it is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its maker ay and it may be to me PERIOD\n",
      "it is the work of a brave man surely in whom there was no guile he rounded this water with his hand deepened and clarified it in his thought and in his will bequeathed it to concord PERIOD\n",
      "i see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection and i can almost say walden is it you PERIOD\n",
      "     it is no dream of mine      to ornament a line      i cannot come nearer to god and heaven      than i live to walden even PERIOD\n",
      "     i am its stony shore      and the breeze that passes oer      in the hollow of my hand      are its water and its sand      and its deepest resort      lies high in my thought PERIOD\n",
      "the cars never pause to look at it yet i fancy that the engineers and firemen and brakemen and those passengers who have a season ticket and see it often are better men for the sight PERIOD\n",
      "the engineer does not forget at night or his nature does not that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at least during the day PERIOD\n",
      "though seen but once it helps to wash out state-street and the engines soot PERIOD\n",
      "one proposes that it be called gods drop PERIOD\n",
      " i have said that walden has no visible inlet nor outlet but it is on the one hand distantly and indirectly related to flints pond which is more elevated by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter and on the other directly and manifestly to concord river which is lower by a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological period it may have flowed and by a little digging which god forbid it can be made to flow thither again PERIOD\n",
      "if by living thus reserved and austere like a hermit in the woods so long it has acquired such wonderful purity who would not regret that the comparatively impure waters of flints pond should be mingled with it or itself should ever go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave PERIOD\n",
      " flints or sandy pond in lincoln our greatest lake and inland sea lies about a mile east of walden PERIOD\n",
      "it is much larger being said to contain one hundred and ninety-seven acres and is more fertile in fish but it is comparatively shallow and not remarkably pure PERIOD\n",
      "a walk through the woods thither was often my recreation PERIOD\n",
      "it was worth the while if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely and see the waves run and remember the life of mariners PERIOD\n",
      "i went a-chestnutting there in the fall on windy days when the nuts were dropping into the water and were washed to my feet and one day as i crept along its sedgy shore the fresh spray blowing in my face i came upon the mouldering wreck of a boat the sides gone and hardly more than the impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes yet its model was sharply defined as if it were a large decayed pad with its veins PERIOD\n",
      "it was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore and had as good a moral PERIOD\n",
      "it is by this time mere vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond shore through which rushes and flags have pushed up PERIOD\n",
      "i used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom at the north end of this pond made firm and hard to the feet of the wader by the pressure of the water and the rushes which grew in indian file in waving lines corresponding to these marks rank behind rank as if the waves had planted them PERIOD\n",
      "there also i have found in considerable quantities curious balls composed apparently of fine grass or roots of pipewort perhaps from half an inch to four inches in diameter and perfectly spherical PERIOD\n",
      "these wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy bottom and are sometimes cast on the shore PERIOD\n",
      "they are either solid grass or have a little sand in the middle PERIOD\n",
      "at first you would say that they were formed by the action of the waves like a pebble yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials half an inch long and they are produced only at one season of the year PERIOD\n",

      "i watched a couple that were fast locked in each others embraces in a little sunny valley amid the chips now at noon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down or life went out PERIOD\n",
      "the smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversarys front and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root having already caused the other to go by the board while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side and as i saw on looking nearer had already divested him of several of his members PERIOD\n",

      "neither manifested the least disposition to retreat PERIOD\n",
      "it was evident that their battle-cry was conquer or die PERIOD\n",
      "in the mean while there came along a single red ant on the hill-side of this valley evidently full of excitement who either had despatched his foe or had not yet taken part in the battle probably the latter for he had lost none of his limbs whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it PERIOD\n",
      "or perchance he was some achilles who had nourished his wrath apart and had now come to avenge or rescue his patroclus PERIOD\n",
      "he saw this unequal combat from afar—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red—he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants then watching his opportunity he sprang upon the black warrior and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore-leg leaving the foe to select among his own members and so there were three united for life as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame PERIOD\n",
      "i should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip and playing their national airs the while to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants PERIOD\n",

      "i took up the chip on which the three i have particularly described were struggling carried it into my house and placed it under a tumbler on my window-sill in order to see the issue PERIOD\n",
      "holding a microscope to the first-mentioned red ant i saw that though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy having severed his remaining feeler his own breast was all torn away exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce and the dark carbuncles of the sufferers eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite PERIOD\n",
      "they struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler and when i looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow still apparently as firmly fastened as ever and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg and i know not how many other wounds to divest himself of them which at length after half an hour more he accomplished PERIOD\n",
      "i raised the glass and he went off over the window-sill in that crippled state PERIOD\n",

      "when compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river like black motes in the sky and when i thought they had gone off thither long since they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of walden i do not know unless they love its water for the same reason that i do PERIOD\n",
      " house-warming in october i went a-graping to the river meadows and loaded myself with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food PERIOD\n",
      "there too i admired though i did not gather the cranberries small waxen gems pendants of the meadow grass pearly and red which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only and sells the spoils of the meads to boston and new york destined to be jammed to satisfy the tastes of lovers of nature there PERIOD\n",

      "it was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of lincoln—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad—with a bag on my shoulder and a stick to open burrs with in my hand for i did not always wait for the frost amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays whose half-consumed nuts i sometimes stole for the burrs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones PERIOD\n",
      "occasionally i climbed and shook the trees PERIOD\n",
      "they grew also behind my house and one large tree which almost overshadowed it was when in flower a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit the last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burrs before they fell PERIOD\n",

      "the first ice is especially interesting and perfect being hard dark and transparent and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick like a skater insect on the surface of the water and study the bottom at your leisure only two or three inches distant like a picture behind a glass and the water is necessarily always smooth then PERIOD\n",
      "there are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks and for wrecks it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute grains of white quartz PERIOD\n",
      "perhaps these have creased it for you find some of their cases in the furrows though they are deep and broad for them to make PERIOD\n",
      "but the ice itself is the object of most interest though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it PERIOD\n",
      "if you examine it closely the morning after it freezes you find that the greater part of the bubbles which at first appeared to be within it are against its under surface and that more are continually rising from the bottom while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark that is you see the water through it PERIOD\n",
      "these bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter very clear and beautiful and you see your face reflected in them through the ice PERIOD\n",
      "there may be thirty or forty of them to a square inch PERIOD\n",
      "there are also already within the ice narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long sharp cones with the apex upward or oftener if the ice is quite fresh minute spherical bubbles one directly above another like a string of beads PERIOD\n",
      "but these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath PERIOD\n",
      "i sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice and those which broke through carried in air with them which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath PERIOD\n",
      "one day when i came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward i found that those large bubbles were still perfect though an inch more of ice had formed as i could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake PERIOD\n",
      "but as the last two days had been very warm like an indian summer the ice was not now transparent showing the dark green color of the water and the bottom but opaque and whitish or gray and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together and lost their regularity they were no longer one directly over another but often like silvery coins poured from a bag one overlapping another or in thin flakes as if occupying slight cleavages PERIOD\n",
      "the beauty of the ice was gone and it was too late to study the bottom PERIOD\n",
      "being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice i broke out a cake containing a middling sized one and turned it bottom upward PERIOD\n",
      "the new ice had formed around and under the bubble so that it was included between the two ices PERIOD\n",
      "it was wholly in the lower ice but close against the upper and was flattish or perhaps slightly lenticular with a rounded edge a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter and i was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle leaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble hardly an eighth of an inch thick and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward and probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles which were a foot in diameter PERIOD\n",
      "i inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which i had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise and that each in its degree had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it PERIOD\n",
      "these are the little air-guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop PERIOD\n",

      "for sounds in winter nights and often in winter days i heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum the very lingua vernacula of walden wood and quite familiar to me at last though i never saw the bird while it was making it PERIOD\n",

      "suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very near me with the most harsh and tremendous voice i ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods responded at regular intervals to the goose as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from hudsons bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native and boo-hoo him out of concord horizon PERIOD\n",

      "sometimes i heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust in moonlight nights in search of a partridge or other game barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs as if laboring with some anxiety or seeking expression struggling for light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets for if we take the ages into our account may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men PERIOD\n",

      "in the course of the winter i threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet-corn which had not got ripe on to the snow crust by my door and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it PERIOD\n",
      "in the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal PERIOD\n",
      "all day long the red squirrels came and went and afforded me much entertainment by their manœuvres PERIOD\n",
      "one would approach at first warily through the shrub-oaks running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind now a few paces this way with wonderful speed and waste of energy making inconceivable haste with his trotters as if it were for a wager and now as many paces that way but never getting on more than half a rod at a time and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset as if all the eyes in the universe were fixed on him—for all the motions of a squirrel even in the most solitary recesses of the forest imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girl—wasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance—i never saw one walk—and then suddenly before you could say jack robinson he would be in the top of a young pitch-pine winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time—for no reason that i could ever detect or he himself was aware of i suspect PERIOD\n",
      "at length he would reach the corn and selecting a suitable ear frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pile before my window where he looked me in the face and there sit for hours supplying himself with a new ear from time to time nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food tasting only the inside of the kernel and the ear which was held balanced over the stick by one paw slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty as if suspecting that it had life with a mind not made up whether to get it again or a new one or be off now thinking of corn then listening to hear what was in the wind PERIOD\n",
      "so the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon till at last seizing some longer and plumper one considerably bigger than himself and skilfully balancing it he would set out with it to the woods like a tiger with a buffalo by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the while making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal being determined to put it through at any rate—a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow—and so he would get off with it to where he lived perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant and i would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various directions PERIOD\n",
      "at length the jays arrive whose discordant screams were heard long before as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree nearer and nearer and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped PERIOD\n",
      "then sitting on a pitch-pine bough they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them and after great labor they disgorge it and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills PERIOD\n",
      "they were manifestly thieves and i had not much respect for them but the squirrels though at first shy went to work as if they were taking what was their own PERIOD\n",
      "meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks which picking up the crumbs the squirrels had dropped flew to the nearest twig and placing them under their claws hammered away at them with their little bills as if it were an insect in the bark till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats PERIOD\n",
      "a little flock of these tit-mice came daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile or the crumbs at my door with faint flitting lisping notes like the tinkling of icicles in the grass or else with sprightly day day day or more rarely in spring-like days a wiry summery phe-be from the wood-side PERIOD\n",
      "they were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which i was carrying in and pecked at the sticks without fear PERIOD\n",
      "i once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while i was hoeing in a village garden and i felt that i was more distinguished by that circumstance than i should have been by any epaulet i could have worn PERIOD\n",
      "the squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar and occasionally stepped upon my shoe when that was the nearest way PERIOD\n",
      "when the ground was not yet quite covered and again near the end of winter when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my wood-pile the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there PERIOD\n",
      "whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dust for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter PERIOD\n",
      "it is frequently covered up by drifts and it is said sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow where it remains concealed for a day or two PERIOD\n",
      " i used to start them in the open land also where they had come out of the woods at sunset to bud the wild apple-trees PERIOD\n",
      "they will come regularly every evening to particular trees where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little PERIOD\n",
      "i am glad that the partridge gets fed at any rate PERIOD\n",
      "it is natures own bird which lives on buds and diet-drink PERIOD\n",
      "in dark winter mornings or in short winter afternoons i sometimes heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp unable to resist the instinct of the chase and the note of the hunting horn at intervals proving that man was in the rear PERIOD\n",
      "the woods ring again and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond nor following pack pursuing their actæon PERIOD\n",
      "and perhaps at evening i see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy seeking their inn PERIOD\n",
      "they tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe or if he would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake him but having left his pursuers far behind he stops to rest and listen till they come up and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts where the hunters await him PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes however he will run upon a wall many rods and then leap off far to one side and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent PERIOD\n",
      "a hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles run part way across and then return to the same shore PERIOD\n",
      "ere long the hounds arrived but here they lost the scent PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door and circle round my house and yelp and hound without regarding me as if afflicted by a species of madness so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit PERIOD\n",
      "thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox for a wise hound will forsake every thing else for this PERIOD\n",
      "one day a man came to my hut from lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track and had been hunting for a week by himself PERIOD\n",
      "but i fear that he was not the wiser for all i told him for every time i attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking what do you do here PERIOD\n",
      " he had lost a dog but found a man PERIOD\n",
      "one old hunter who has a dry tongue who used to come to bathe in walden once every year when the water was warmest and at such times looked in upon me told me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in walden wood and as he walked the wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road and his swift bullet had not touched him PERIOD\n",
      "some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit hunting on their own account and disappeared again in the woods PERIOD\n",
      "late in the afternoon as he was resting in the thick woods south of walden he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward fair haven still pursuing the fox and on they came their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer now from well-meadow now from the baker farm PERIOD\n",
      "for a long time he stood still and listened to their music so sweet to a hunters ear when suddenly the fox appeared threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves swift and still keeping the ground leaving his pursuers far behind and leaping upon a rock amid the woods he sat erect and listening with his back to the hunter PERIOD\n",
      "for a moment compassion restrained the latters arm but that was a short-lived mood and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled and whang—the fox rolling over the rock lay dead on the ground PERIOD\n",
      "the hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds PERIOD\n",
      "still on they came and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry PERIOD\n",
      "at length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground and snapping the air as if possessed and ran directly to the rock but spying the dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement and walked round and round him in silence and one by one her pups arrived and like their mother were sobered into silence by the mystery PERIOD\n",
      "then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst and the mystery was solved PERIOD\n",
      "they waited in silence while he skinned the fox then followed the brush a while and at length turned off into the woods again PERIOD\n",
      "that evening a weston squire came to the concord hunters cottage to inquire for his hounds and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from weston woods PERIOD\n",
      "the concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin but the other declined it and departed PERIOD\n",
      "he did not find his hounds that night but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house for the night whence having been well fed they took their departure early in the morning PERIOD\n",
      "the hunter who told me this could remember one sam nutting who used to hunt bears on fair haven ledges and exchange their skins for rum in concord village who told him even that he had seen a moose there PERIOD\n",
      "nutting had a famous fox-hound named burgoyne—he pronounced it bugine—which my informant used to borrow PERIOD\n",

      "the hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here PERIOD\n",

      "squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts PERIOD\n",
      "there were scores of pitch-pines around my house from one to four inches in diameter which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter—a norwegian winter for them for the snow lay long and deep and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other diet PERIOD\n",
      "these trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summer and many of them had grown a foot though completely girdled but after another winter such were without exception dead PERIOD\n",
      "it is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner gnawing round instead of up and down it but perhaps it is necessary in order to thin these trees which are wont to grow up densely PERIOD\n",

      "standing on the snow-covered plain as if in a pasture amid the hills i cut my way first through a foot of snow and then a foot of ice and open a window under my feet where kneeling to drink i look down into the quiet parlor of the fishes pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground glass with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky corresponding to the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants PERIOD\n",

      "when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was sometimes amused by the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted PERIOD\n",
      "he would perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder a foot or more above the ice and tied a dry oak leaf to it which being pulled down would show when he had a bite PERIOD\n",

      "ah the pickerel of walden when i see them lying on the ice or in the well which the fisherman cuts in the ice making a little hole to admit the water i am always surprised by their rare beauty as if they were fabulous fishes they are so foreign to the streets even to the woods foreign as arabia to our concord life PERIOD\n",
      "they possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets PERIOD\n",
      "they are not green like the pines nor gray like the stones nor blue like the sky but they have to my eyes if possible yet rarer colors like flowers and precious stones as if they were the pearls the animalized nuclei or crystals of the walden water PERIOD\n",
      "they of course are walden all over and all through are themselves small waldens in the animal kingdom waldenses PERIOD\n",
      "it is surprising that they are caught here—that in this deep and capacious spring far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the walden road this great gold and emerald fish swims PERIOD\n",
      "i never chanced to see its kind in any market it would be the cynosure of all eyes there PERIOD\n",
      "easily with a few convulsive quirks they give up their watery ghosts like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven PERIOD\n",
      " waldenpondmap  as i was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of walden pond i surveyed it carefully before the ice broke up early in 46 with compass and chain and sounding line PERIOD\n",
      "there have been many stories told about the bottom or rather no bottom of this pond which certainly had no foundation for themselves PERIOD\n",
      "it is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it PERIOD\n",
      "i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in this neighborhood PERIOD\n",
      "many have believed that walden reached quite through to the other side of the globe PERIOD\n",
      "some who have lain flat on the ice for a long time looking down through the illusive medium perchance with watery eyes into the bargain and driven to hasty conclusions by the fear of catching cold in their breasts have seen vast holes into which a load of hay might be driven if there were any body to drive it the undoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernal regions from these parts PERIOD\n",
      "others have gone down from the village with a fifty-six and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have failed to find any bottom for while the fifty-six was resting by the way they were paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for marvellousness PERIOD\n",
      "but i can assure my readers that walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable though at an unusual depth PERIOD\n",
      "i fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone weighing about a pound and a half and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom by having to pull so much harder before the water got underneath to help me PERIOD\n",
      "the greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet to which may be added the five feet which it has risen since making one hundred and seven PERIOD\n",
      "this is a remarkable depth for so small an area yet not an inch of it can be spared by the imagination PERIOD\n",
      "what if all ponds were shallow PERIOD\n",
      "would it not react on the minds of men PERIOD\n",
      "i am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol PERIOD\n",
      "while men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless PERIOD\n",
      "a factory owner hearing what depth i had found thought that it could not be true for judging from his acquaintance with dams sand would not lie at so steep an angle PERIOD\n",
      "but the deepest ponds are not so deep in proportion to their area as most suppose and if drained would not leave very remarkable valleys PERIOD\n",
      "they are not like cups between the hills for this one which is so unusually deep for its area appears in a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallow plate PERIOD\n",
      "most ponds emptied would leave a meadow no more hollow than we frequently see PERIOD\n",
      "william gilpin who is so admirable in all that relates to landscapes and usually so correct standing at the head of loch fyne in scotland which he describes as a bay of salt water sixty or seventy fathoms deep four miles in breadth and about fifty miles long surrounded by mountains observes if we could have seen it immediately after the diluvian crash or whatever convulsion of nature occasioned it before the waters gushed in what a horrid chasm must it have appeared      so high as heaved the tumid hills so low      down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep      capacious bed of waters— PERIOD\n",
      " but if using the shortest diameter of loch fyne we apply these proportions to walden which as we have seen appears already in a vertical section only like a shallow plate it will appear four times as shallow PERIOD\n",
      "so much for the increased horrors of the chasm of loch fyne when emptied PERIOD\n",
      "no doubt many a smiling valley with its stretching cornfields occupies exactly such a horrid chasm from which the waters have receded though it requires the insight and the far sight of the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact PERIOD\n",
      "often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in the low horizon hills and no subsequent elevation of the plain has been necessary to conceal their history PERIOD\n",
      "but it is easiest as they who work on the highways know to find the hollows by the puddles after a shower PERIOD\n",
      "the amount of it is the imagination give it the least license dives deeper and soars higher than nature goes PERIOD\n",
      "so probably the depth of the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its breadth PERIOD\n",
      "as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottom with greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do not freeze over and i was surprised at its general regularity PERIOD\n",
      "in the deepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field which is exposed to the sun wind and plough PERIOD\n",
      "in one instance on a line arbitrarily chosen the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty rods and generally near the middle i could calculate the variation for each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or four inches PERIOD\n",
      "some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes even in quiet sandy ponds like this but the effect of water under these circumstances is to level all inequalities PERIOD\n",
      "the regularity of the bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the neighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the soundings quite across the pond and its direction could be determined by observing the opposite shore PERIOD\n",
      "cape becomes bar and plain shoal and valley and gorge deep water and channel PERIOD\n",
      "when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch and put down the soundings more than a hundred in all i observed this remarkable coincidence PERIOD\n",
      "having noticed that the number indicating the greatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map i laid a rule on the map lengthwise and then breadthwise and found to my surprise that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest breadth exactly at the point of greatest depth notwithstanding that the middle is so nearly level the outline of the pond far from regular and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into the coves and i said to myself who knows but this hint would conduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle PERIOD\n",
      "is not this the rule also for the height of mountains regarded as the opposite of valleys PERIOD\n",
      "we know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part PERIOD\n",
      "of five coves three or all which had been sounded were observed to have a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within so that the bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only horizontally but vertically and to form a basin or independent pond the direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar PERIOD\n",
      "every harbor on the sea-coast also has its bar at its entrance PERIOD\n",
      "in proportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length the water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin PERIOD\n",
      "given then the length and breadth of the cove and the character of the surrounding shore and you have almost elements enough to make out a formula for all cases PERIOD\n",
      "in order to see how nearly i could guess with this experience at the deepest point in a pond by observing the outlines of its surface and the character of its shores alone i made a plan of white pond which contains about forty-one acres and like this has no island in it nor any visible inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadth fell very near the line of least breadth where two opposite capes approached each other and two opposite bays receded i ventured to mark a point a short distance from the latter line but still on the line of greatest length as the deepest PERIOD\n",
      "the deepest part was found to be within one hundred feet of this still farther in the direction to which i had inclined and was only one foot deeper namely sixty feet PERIOD\n",
      "of course a stream running through or an island in the pond would make the problem much more complicated PERIOD\n",
      "if we knew all the laws of nature we should need only one fact or the description of one actual phenomenon to infer all the particular results at that point PERIOD\n",
      "now we know only a few laws and our result is vitiated not of course by any confusion or irregularity in nature but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation PERIOD\n",
      "our notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances which we detect but the harmony which results from a far greater number of seemingly conflicting but really concurring laws which we have not detected is still more wonderful PERIOD\n",
      "the particular laws are as our points of view as to the traveller a mountain outline varies with every step and it has an infinite number of profiles though absolutely but one form PERIOD\n",
      "even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended in its entireness PERIOD\n",
      "what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics PERIOD\n",
      "it is the law of average PERIOD\n",
      "such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us toward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draw lines through the length and breadth of the aggregate of a mans particular daily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets and where they intersect will be the height or depth of his character PERIOD\n",
      "perhaps we need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or circumstances to infer his depth and concealed bottom PERIOD\n",
      "if he is surrounded by mountainous circumstances an achillean shore whose peaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom they suggest a corresponding depth in him PERIOD\n",
      "but a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that side PERIOD\n",
      "in our bodies a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a corresponding depth of thought PERIOD\n",
      "also there is a bar across the entrance of our every cove or particular inclination each is our harbor for a season in which we are detained and partially land-locked PERIOD\n",
      "these inclinations are not whimsical usually but their form size and direction are determined by the promontories of the shore the ancient axes of elevation PERIOD\n",
      "when this bar is gradually increased by storms tides or currents or there is a subsidence of the waters so that it reaches to the surface that which was at first but an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an individual lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought secures its own conditions changes perhaps from salt to fresh becomes a sweet sea dead sea or a marsh PERIOD\n",
      "at the advent of each individual into this life may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface somewhere PERIOD\n",
      "it is true we are such poor navigators that our thoughts for the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast are conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy or steer for the public ports of entry and go into the dry docks of science where they merely refit for this world and no natural currents concur to individualize them PERIOD\n",
      "as for the inlet or outlet of walden i have not discovered any but rain and snow and evaporation though perhaps with a thermometer and a line such places may be found for where the water flows into the pond it will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter PERIOD\n",
      "when the ice-men were at work here in 46–7 the cakes sent to the shore were one day rejected by those who were stacking them up there not being thick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutters thus discovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inches thinner than elsewhere which made them think that there was an inlet there PERIOD\n",
      "they also showed me in another place what they thought was a leach hole through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a neighboring meadow pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it PERIOD\n",
      "it was a small cavity under ten feet of water but i think that i can warrant the pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that PERIOD\n",
      "one has suggested that if such a leach hole should be found its connection with the meadow if any existed might be proved by conveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole and then putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow which would catch some of the particles carried through by the current PERIOD\n",
      "while i was surveying the ice which was sixteen inches thick undulated under a slight wind like water PERIOD\n",
      "it is well known that a level cannot be used on ice PERIOD\n",
      "at one rod from the shore its greatest fluctuation when observed by means of a level on land directed toward a graduated staff on the ice was three quarters of an inch though the ice appeared firmly attached to the shore PERIOD\n",
      "it was probably greater in the middle PERIOD\n",
      "who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth PERIOD\n",
      "when two legs of my level were on the shore and the third on the ice and the sights were directed over the latter a rise or fall of the ice of an almost infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across the pond PERIOD\n",
      "when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three or four inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it thus far but the water began immediately to run into these holes and continued to run for two days in deep streams which wore away the ice on every side and contributed essentially if not mainly to dry the surface of the pond for as the water ran in it raised and floated the ice PERIOD\n",
      "this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out PERIOD\n",
      "when such holes freeze and a rain succeeds and finally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all it is beautifully mottled internally by dark figures shaped somewhat like a spiders web what you may call ice rosettes produced by the channels worn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes also when the ice was covered with shallow puddles i saw a double shadow of myself one standing on the head of the other one on the ice the other on the trees or hill-side PERIOD\n",
      " while yet it is cold january and snow and ice are thick and solid the prudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer drink impressively even pathetically wise to foresee the heat and thirst of july now in january—wearing a thick coat and mittens when so many things are not provided for PERIOD\n",
      "it may be that he lays up no treasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next PERIOD\n",
      "he cuts and saws the solid pond unroofs the house of fishes and carts off their very element and air held fast by chains and stakes like corded wood through the favoring winter air to wintry cellars to underlie the summer there PERIOD\n",
      "it looks like solidified azure as far off it is drawn through the streets PERIOD\n",
      "these ice-cutters are a merry race full of jest and sport and when i went among them they were wont to invite me to saw pit-fashion with them i standing underneath PERIOD\n",
      "in the winter of 46–7 there came a hundred men of hyperborean extraction swoop down on to our pond one morning with many car-loads of ungainly-looking farming tools sleds ploughs drill-barrows turf-knives spades saws rakes and each man was armed with a double-pointed pike-staff such as is not described in the new-england farmer or the cultivator PERIOD\n",
      "i did not know whether they had come to sow a crop of winter rye or some other kind of grain recently introduced from iceland PERIOD\n",
      "as i saw no manure i judged that they meant to skim the land as i had done thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow long enough PERIOD\n",
      "they said that a gentleman farmer who was behind the scenes wanted to double his money which as i understood amounted to half a million already but in order to cover each one of his dollars with another he took off the only coat ay the skin itself of walden pond in the midst of a hard winter PERIOD\n",
      "they went to work at once ploughing harrowing rolling furrowing in admirable order as if they were bent on making this a model farm but when i was looking sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow a gang of fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself with a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the water—for it was a very springy soil—indeed all the terra firma there was—and haul it away on sleds and then i guessed that they must be cutting peat in a bog PERIOD\n",
      "so they came and went every day with a peculiar shriek from the locomotive from and to some point of the polar regions as it seemed to me like a flock of arctic snow-birds PERIOD\n",
      "but sometimes squaw walden had her revenge and a hired man walking behind his team slipped through a crack in the ground down toward tartarus and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man almost gave up his animal heat and was glad to take refuge in my house and acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove or sometimes the frozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare or a plough got set in the furrow and had to be cut out PERIOD\n",
      "to speak literally a hundred irishmen with yankee overseers came from cambridge every day to get out the ice PERIOD\n",
      "they divided it into cakes by methods too well known to require description and these being sledded to the shore were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform and raised by grappling irons and block and tackle worked by horses on to a stack as surely as so many barrels of flour and there placed evenly side by side and row upon row as if they formed the solid base of an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds PERIOD\n",
      "they told me that in a good day they could get out a thousand tons which was the yield of about one acre PERIOD\n",
      "deep ruts and cradle holes were worn in the ice as on terra firma by the passage of the sleds over the same track and the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets PERIOD\n",
      "they stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile thirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square putting hay between the outside layers to exclude the air for when the wind though never so cold finds a passage through it will wear large cavities leaving slight supports or studs only here and there and finally topple it down PERIOD\n",
      "at first it looked like a vast blue fort or valhalla but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the crevices and this became covered with rime and icicles it looked like a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin built of azure-tinted marble the abode of winter that old man we see in the almanac—his shanty as if he had a design to estivate with us PERIOD\n",
      "they calculated that not twenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination and that two or three per cent would be wasted in the cars PERIOD\n",
      "however a still greater part of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended for either because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected containing more air than usual or for some other reason it never got to market PERIOD\n",
      "this heap made in the winter of 46–7 and estimated to contain ten thousand tons was finally covered with hay and boards and though it was unroofed the following july and a part of it carried off the rest remaining exposed to the sun it stood over that summer and the next winter and was not quite melted till september 1848 PERIOD\n",
      "thus the pond recovered the greater part PERIOD\n",
      "like the water the walden ice seen near at hand has a green tint but at a distance is beautifully blue and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the river or the merely greenish ice of some ponds a quarter of a mile off PERIOD\n",
      "sometimes one of those great cakes slips from the ice-mans sled into the village street and lies there for a week like a great emerald an object of interest to all passers PERIOD\n",
      "i have noticed that a portion of walden which in the state of water was green will often when frozen appear from the same point of view blue PERIOD\n",
      "so the hollows about this pond will sometimes in the winter be filled with a greenish water somewhat like its own but the next day will have frozen blue PERIOD\n",
      "perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and air they contain and the most transparent is the bluest PERIOD\n",
      "ice is an interesting subject for contemplation PERIOD\n",
      "they told me that they had some in the ice-houses at fresh pond five years old which was as good as ever PERIOD\n",
      "why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid but frozen remains sweet forever PERIOD\n",
      "it is commonly said that this is the difference between the affections and the intellect PERIOD\n",
      "thus for sixteen days i saw from my window a hundred men at work like busy husbandmen with teams and horses and apparently all the implements of farming such a picture as we see on the first page of the almanac and as often as i looked out i was reminded of the fable of the lark and the reapers or the parable of the sower and the like and now they are all gone and in thirty days more probably i shall look from the same window on the pure sea-green walden water there reflecting the clouds and the trees and sending up its evaporations in solitude and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood there PERIOD\n",
      "perhaps i shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes himself or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat like a floating leaf beholding his form reflected in the waves where lately a hundred men securely labored PERIOD\n",
      "thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of charleston and new orleans of madras and bombay and calcutta drink at my well PERIOD\n",
      "in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions PERIOD\n",
      "i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the bramin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug PERIOD\n",
      "i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well PERIOD\n",
      "the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges PERIOD\n",
      "with favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of atlantis and the hesperides makes the periplus of hanno and floating by ternate and tidore and the mouth of the persian gulf melts in the tropic gales of the indian seas and is landed in ports of which alexander only heard the names PERIOD\n",
      " spring the opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond to break up earlier for the water agitated by the wind even in cold weather wears away the surrounding ice PERIOD\n",
      "but such was not the effect on walden that year for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the place of the old PERIOD\n",
      "this pond never breaks up so soon as the others in this neighborhood on account both of its greater depth and its having no stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice PERIOD\n",
      "i never knew it to open in the course of a winter not excepting that of 52–3 which gave the ponds so severe a trial PERIOD\n",
      "it commonly opens about the first of april a week or ten days later than flints pond and fair-haven beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts where it began to freeze PERIOD\n",
      "it indicates better than any water hereabouts the absolute progress of the season being least affected by transient changes of temperature PERIOD\n",
      "a severe cold of a few days duration in march may very much retard the opening of the former ponds while the temperature of walden increases almost uninterruptedly PERIOD\n",
      "a thermometer thrust into the middle of walden on the 6th of march 1847 stood at 32° or freezing point near the shore at 33° in the middle of flints pond the same day at 32½° at a dozen rods from the shore in shallow water under ice a foot thick at 36° PERIOD\n",
      "this difference of three and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond and the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow show why it should break up so much sooner than walden PERIOD\n",
      "the ice in the shallowest part was at this time several inches thinner than in the middle PERIOD\n",
      "in mid-winter the middle had been the warmest and the ice thinnest there PERIOD\n",
      "so also every one who has waded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is close to the shore where only three or four inches deep than a little distance out and on the surface where it is deep than near the bottom PERIOD\n",
      "in spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the increased temperature of the air and earth but its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water and so also warms the water and melts the under side of the ice at the same time that it is melting it more directly above making it uneven and causing the air bubbles which it contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain PERIOD\n",
      "ice has its grain as well as wood and when a cake begins to rot or comb that is assume the appearance of honey-comb whatever may be its position the air cells are at right angles with what was the water surface PERIOD\n",
      "where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over it is much thinner and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat and i have been told that in the experiment at cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond though the cold air circulated underneath and so had access to both sides the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this advantage PERIOD\n",
      "when a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the snow-ice from walden and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice a rod or more wide about the shores created by this reflected heat PERIOD\n",
      "also as i have said the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath PERIOD\n",
      "the phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small scale PERIOD\n",
      "every morning generally speaking the shallow water is being warmed more rapidly than the deep though it may not be made so warm after all and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the morning PERIOD\n",
      "the day is an epitome of the year PERIOD\n",
      "the night is the winter the morning and evening are the spring and fall and the noon is the summer PERIOD\n",
      "the cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature PERIOD\n",
      "one pleasant morning after a cold night february 24th 1850 having gone to flints pond to spend the day i noticed with surprise that when i struck the ice with the head of my axe it resounded like a gong for many rods around or as if i had struck on a tight drum-head PERIOD\n",
      "the pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise when it felt the influence of the suns rays slanted upon it from over the hills it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult which was kept up three or four hours PERIOD\n",
      "it took a short siesta at noon and boomed once more toward night as the sun was withdrawing his influence PERIOD\n",
      "in the right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great regularity PERIOD\n",
      "but in the middle of the day being full of cracks and the air also being less elastic it had completely lost its resonance and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it PERIOD\n",
      "the fishermen say that the thundering of the pond scares the fishes and prevents their biting PERIOD\n",
      "the pond does not thunder every evening and i cannot tell surely when to expect its thundering but though i may perceive no difference in the weather it does PERIOD\n",
      "who would have suspected so large and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive PERIOD\n",
      "yet it has its law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the spring PERIOD\n",
      "the earth is all alive and covered with papillæ PERIOD\n",
      "the largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in its tube PERIOD\n",
      " one attraction in coming to the woods to live was that i should have leisure and opportunity to see the spring come in PERIOD\n",
      "the ice in the pond at length begins to be honey-combed and i can set my heel in it as i walk PERIOD\n",
      "fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow the days have grown sensibly longer and i see how i shall get through the winter without adding to my wood-pile for large fires are no longer necessary PERIOD\n",
      "i am on the alert for the first signs of spring to hear the chance note of some arriving bird or the striped squirrels chirp for his stores must be now nearly exhausted or see the woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters PERIOD\n",
      "on the 13th of march after i had heard the bluebird song-sparrow and red-wing the ice was still nearly a foot thick PERIOD\n",
      "as the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away by the water nor broken up and floated off as in rivers but though it was completely melted for half a rod in width about the shore the middle was merely honey-combed and saturated with water so that you could put your foot through it when six inches thick but by the next day evening perhaps after a warm rain followed by fog it would have wholly disappeared all gone off with the fog spirited away PERIOD\n",

      "the ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore and there was a smooth and warm sheet of water with a muddy bottom such as the ducks love within and he thought it likely that some would be along pretty soon PERIOD\n",
      "after he had lain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound but singularly grand and impressive unlike any thing he had ever heard gradually swelling and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending a sullen rush and roar which seemed to him all at once like the sound of a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there and seizing his gun he started up in haste and excited but he found to his surprise that the whole body of the ice had started while he lay there and drifted in to the shore and the sound he had heard was made by its edge grating on the shore—at first gently nibbled and crumbled off but at length heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to a considerable height before it came to a stand still PERIOD\n",

      "i wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way PERIOD\n",

      "i could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations which followed them out again without let or hindrance and they were really all that was dangerous PERIOD\n",
      "as they could not reach me they had resolved to punish my body just as boys if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite will abuse his dog PERIOD\n",
      "i saw that the state was half-witted that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons and that it did not know its friends from its foes and i lost all my remaining respect for it and pitied it PERIOD\n",

      "but the jailer said come boys it is time to lock up and so they dispersed and i heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments PERIOD\n",
      "my room-mate was introduced to me by the jailer as a first-rate fellow and a clever man PERIOD\n",
      " when the door was locked he showed me where to hang my hat and how he managed matters there PERIOD\n",
      "the rooms were whitewashed once a month and this one at least was the whitest most simply furnished and probably the neatest apartment in town PERIOD\n",
      "he naturally wanted to know where i came from and what brought me there and when i had told him i asked him in my turn how he came there presuming him to be an honest man of course and as the world goes i believe he was PERIOD\n",
      "why said he they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it PERIOD\n",
      " as near as i could discover he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smoked his pipe there and so a barn was burnt PERIOD\n",

      "he occupied one window and i the other and i saw that if one stayed there long his principal business would be to look out the window PERIOD\n",
      "i had soon read all the tracts that were left there and examined where former prisoners had broken out and where a grate had been sawed off and heard the history of the various occupants of that room for i found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail PERIOD\n",
      "probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed which are afterward printed in a circular form but not published PERIOD\n",
      "i was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape who avenged themselves by singing them PERIOD\n",
      "i pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as i could for fear i should never see him again but at length he showed me which was my bed and left me to blow out the lamp PERIOD\n",
      "it was like travelling into a far country such as i had never expected to behold to lie there for one night PERIOD\n",
      "it seemed to me that i never had heard the town-clock strike before nor the evening sounds of the village for we slept with the windows open which were inside the grating PERIOD\n",
      "it was to see my native village in the light of the middle ages and our concord was turned into a rhine stream and visions of knights and castles passed before me PERIOD\n",
      "they were the voices of old burghers that i heard in the streets PERIOD\n",
      "i was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the adjacent village-inn—a wholly new and rare experience to me PERIOD\n",
      "it was a closer view of my native town PERIOD\n",
      "i was fairly inside of it PERIOD\n",
      "i never had seen its institutions before PERIOD\n",
      "this is one of its peculiar institutions for it is a shire town PERIOD\n",
      "i began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about PERIOD\n",
      "in the morning our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door in small oblong-square tin pans made to fit and holding a pint of chocolate with brown bread and an iron spoon PERIOD\n",
      "when they called for the vessels again i was green enough to return what bread i had left but my comrade seized it and said that i should lay that up for lunch or dinner PERIOD\n",
      "soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field whither he went every day and would not be back till noon so he bade me good-day saying that he doubted if he should see me again PERIOD\n",
      "when i came out of prison—for some one interfered and paid the tax—i did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged a gray-headed man and yet a change had to my eyes come over the scene—the town and state and country—greater than any that mere time could effect PERIOD\n",
      "i saw yet more distinctly the state in which i lived PERIOD\n",
      "i saw to what extent the people among whom i lived could be trusted as good neighbors and friends that their friendship was for summer weather only that they did not greatly purpose to do right that they were a distinct race from me by their prejudices and superstitions as the chinamen and malays are that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks not even to their property that after all they were not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them and hoped by a certain outward observance and a few prayers and by walking in a particular straight though useless path from time to time to save their souls PERIOD\n",
      "this may be to judge my neighbors harshly for i believe that most of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in their village PERIOD\n",
      "it was formerly the custom in our village when a poor debtor came out of jail for his acquaintances to salute him looking through their fingers which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window how do ye do PERIOD\n",
      " my neighbors did not thus salute me but first looked at me and then at one another as if i had returned from a long journey PERIOD\n",
      "i was put into jail as i was going to the shoemakers to get a shoe which was mended PERIOD\n",
      "when i was let out the next morning i proceeded to finish my errand and having put on my mended shoe joined a huckleberry party who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct and in half an hour—for the horse was soon tackled—was in the midst of a huckleberry field on one of our highest hills two miles off and then the state was nowhere to be seen PERIOD\n",
      "this is the whole history of my prisons PERIOD\n",
      "  i have never declined paying the highway tax because i am as desirous of being a good neighbor as i am of being a bad subject and as for supporting schools i am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen now PERIOD\n",
      "it is for no particular item in the tax-bill that i refuse to pay it PERIOD\n",
      "i simply wish to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually PERIOD\n",
      "i do not care to trace the course of my dollar if i could till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one with—the dollar is innocent—but i am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance PERIOD\n",
      "in fact i quietly declare war with the state after my fashion though i will still make use and get what advantages of her i can as is usual in such cases PERIOD\n",
      "if others pay the tax which is demanded of me from a sympathy with the state they do but what they have already done in their own case or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the state requires PERIOD\n",
      "if they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed to save his property or prevent his going to jail it is because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with the public good PERIOD\n",
      "this then is my position at present PERIOD\n",
      "but one cannot be too much on his guard in such a case lest his actions be biassed by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions of men PERIOD\n",
      "let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour PERIOD\n",
      "i think sometimes why this people mean well they are only ignorant they would do better if they knew how why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to PERIOD\n",
      "but i think again this is no reason why i should do as they do or permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind PERIOD\n",
      "again i sometimes say to myself when many millions of men without heat without ill-will without personal feeling of any kind demand of you a few shillings only without the possibility such is their constitution of retracting or altering their present demand and without the possibility on your side of appeal to any other millions why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force PERIOD\n",
      "you do not resist cold and hunger the winds and the waves thus obstinately you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities PERIOD\n",
      "you do not put your head into the fire PERIOD\n",
      "but just in proportion as i regard this as not wholly a brute force but partly a human force and consider that i have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men and not of mere brute or inanimate things i see that appeal is possible first and instantaneously from them to the maker of them and secondly from them to themselves PERIOD\n",
      "but if i put my head deliberately into the fire there is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have only myself to blame PERIOD\n",
      "if i could convince myself that i have any right to be satisfied with men as they are and to treat them accordingly and not according in some respects to my requisitions and expectations of what they and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalist i should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are and say it is the will of god PERIOD\n",
      "and above all there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute or natural force that i can resist this with some effect but i cannot expect like orpheus to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts PERIOD\n",
      "i do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation PERIOD\n",
      "i do not wish to split hairs to make fine distinctions or set myself up as better than my neighbors PERIOD\n",
      "i seek rather i may say even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land PERIOD\n",
      "i am but too ready to conform to them PERIOD\n",
      "indeed i have reason to suspect myself on this head and each year as the tax-gatherer comes round i find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the general and state governments and the spirit of the people to discover a pretext for conformity PERIOD\n",
      "     we must affect our country as our parents      and if at any time we alienate      out love of industry from doing it honor      we must respect effects and teach the soul      matter of conscience and religion      and not desire of rule or benefit PERIOD\n",
      " i believe that the state will soon be able to take all my work of this sort out of my hands and then i shall be no better patriot than my fellow-countrymen PERIOD\n",
      "seen from a lower point of view the constitution with all its faults is very good the law and the courts are very respectable even this state and this american government are in many respects very admirable and rare things to be thankful for such as a great many have described them seen from a higher still and the highest who shall say what they are or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all PERIOD\n",
      "however the government does not concern me much and i shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it PERIOD\n",
      "it is not many moments that i live under a government even in this world PERIOD\n",
      "if a man is thought-free fancy-free imagination-free that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him PERIOD\n",
      "i know that most men think differently from myself but those whose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects content me as little as any PERIOD\n",
      "statesmen and legislators standing so completely within the institution never distinctly and nakedly behold it PERIOD\n",
      "they speak of moving society but have no resting-place without it PERIOD\n",
      "they may be men of a certain experience and discrimination and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems for which we sincerely thank them but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits PERIOD\n",

      "his words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government but for thinkers and those who legislate for all time he never once glances at the subject PERIOD\n",
      "i know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of his minds range and hospitality PERIOD\n",
      "yet compared with the cheap professions of most reformers and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general his are almost the only sensible and valuable words and we thank heaven for him PERIOD\n",

      " still thinking of the sanction which the constitution gives to slavery he says because it was part of the original compact—let it stand PERIOD\n",
      " notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political relations and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellect—what for instance it behoves a man to do here in america today with regard to slavery but ventures or is driven to make some such desperate answer as the following while professing to speak absolutely and as a private man—from which what new and singular code of social duties might be inferred PERIOD\n",
      "—the manner says he in which the governments of those states where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration under the responsibility to their constituents to the general laws of propriety humanity and justice and to god PERIOD\n",
      "associations formed elsewhere springing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever to do with it PERIOD\n",

      " they who know of no purer sources of truth who have traced up its stream no higher stand and wisely stand by the bible and the constitution and drink at it there with reverence and humanity but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool gird up their loins once more and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountain-head PERIOD\n",

      "our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom of union and of rectitude to a nation PERIOD\n",
      "they have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance commerce and manufactures and agriculture PERIOD\n",
      "if we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in congress for our guidance uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people america would not long retain her rank among the nations PERIOD\n",

      "the authority of government even such as i am willing to submit to—for i will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than i and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well—is still an impure one to be strictly just it must have the sanction and consent of the governed PERIOD\n",
